735	746	747	747	he	107	" Whatever have you been doing with yourself , Watson ? "
762	777	747	747	he	107	" You are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut . "
802	806	807	807	he	107	" Poor devil ! "
820	828	813	813	he	107	" What are you up to now ? "
829	834	835	835	I	0	" Looking for lodgings , "
838	859	835	835	I	0	" Trying to solve the problem as to whether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable price . "
860	867	869	870	my companion	243	" That 's a strange thing , "
872	889	869	870	my companion	243	" you are the second man to - day that has used that expression to me . "
890	897	898	898	I	0	" And who was the first ? "
901	951	869	870	my companion	243	" A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital . He was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone to go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found , and which were too much for his purse . "
952	956	957	957	I	0	" By Jove ! "
960	992	957	957	I	0	" if he really wants someone to share the rooms and the expense , I am the very man for him . I should prefer having a partner to being alone . "
1006	1015	1016	1016	he	107	" You do n't know Sherlock Holmes yet , "
1019	1032	1016	1016	he	107	" perhaps you would not care for him as a constant companion . "
1033	1042	957	957	I	0	" Why , what is there against him ? "
1043	1085	1016	1016	he	107	" Oh , I did n't say there was anything against him . He is a little queer in his ideas - an enthusiast in some branches of science . As far as I know he is a decent fellow enough . "
1086	1094	1096	1096	I.	0	" A medical student , I suppose ? "
1097	1176	1016	1016	he	107	" No - I have no idea what he intends to go in for . I believe he is well up in anatomy , and he is a first - class chemist ; but , as far as I know , he has never taken out any systematic medical classes . His studies are very desultory and eccentric , but he has amassed a lot of out - of - the way knowledge which would astonish his professors . "
1177	1190	1191	1191	I	0	" Did you never ask him what he was going in for ? "
1194	1222	1016	1016	he	107	" No ; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out , though he can be communicative enough when the fancy seizes him . "
1223	1231	1232	1232	I	0	" I should like to meet him , "
1235	1295	1232	1232	I	0	" If I am to lodge with anyone , I should prefer a man of studious and quiet habits . I am not strong enough yet to stand much noise or excitement . I had enough of both in Afghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence . How could I meet this friend of yours ? "
1296	1306	1308	1309	my companion	243	" He is sure to be at the laboratory , "
1311	1342	1308	1309	my companion	243	" He either avoids the place for weeks , or else he works there from morning to night . If you like , we shall drive round together after luncheon . "
1343	1346	1347	1347	I	0	" Certainly , "
1393	1408	1409	1409	he	107	" You must n't blame me if you do n't get on with him , "
1412	1444	1409	1409	he	107	" I know nothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally in the laboratory . You proposed this arrangement , so you must not hold me responsible . "
1445	1460	1461	1461	I	0	" If we do n't get on it will be easy to part company , "
1464	1472	1473	1473	I	0	" It seems to me , Stamford , "
1482	1518	1473	1473	I	0	" that you have some reason for washing your hands of the matter . Is this fellow 's temper so formidable , or what is it ? Do n't be mealy - mouthed about it . "
1519	1529	1530	1530	he	107	" It is not easy to express the inexpressible , "
1536	1627	1530	1530	he	107	" Holmes is a little too scientific for my tastes - it approaches to cold - bloodedness . I could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch of the latest vegetable alkaloid , not out of malevolence , you understand , but simply out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an accurate idea of the effects . To do him justice , I think that he would take it himself with the same readiness . He appears to have a passion for definite and exact knowledge . "
1628	1633	1473	1473	I	0	" Very right too . "
1634	1670	1530	1530	he	107	" Yes , but it may be pushed to excess . When it comes to beating the subjects in the dissecting - rooms with a stick , it is certainly taking rather a bizarre shape . "
1671	1676	1473	1473	I	0	" Beating the subjects ! "
1677	1701	1530	1530	he	107	" Yes , to verify how far bruises may be produced after death . I saw him at it with my own eyes . "
1702	1714	1473	1473	I	0	" And yet you say he is not a medical student ? "
1715	1743	1745	1745	he	250	" No . Heaven knows what the objects of his studies are . But here we are , and you must form your own impressions about him . "
1913	1924	1925	1925	he	258	" I 've found it ! I 've found it , "
1943	1962	1925	1925	he	258	" I have found a re - agent which is precipitated by hæmoglobin , and by nothing else . "
1980	1988	1990	1990	Stamford	107	" Dr. Watson , Mr. Sherlock Holmes , "
1995	2000	2001	2001	he	258	" How are you ? "
2021	2031	2001	2001	he	258	" You have been in Afghanistan , I perceive . "
2032	2041	2042	2042	I	0	" How on earth did you know that ? "
2047	2051	2053	2053	he	258	" Never mind , "
2059	2079	2053	2053	he	258	" The question now is about hæmoglobin . No doubt you see the significance of this discovery of mine ? "
2080	2090	2091	2091	I	0	" It is interesting , chemically , no doubt , "
2094	2099	2091	2091	I	0	" but practically - - "
2100	2137	2138	2138	He	258	" Why , man , it is the most practical medico - legal discovery for years . Do n't you see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains . Come over here now ! "
2164	2172	2173	2173	he	258	" Let us have some fresh blood , "
2197	2258	2173	2173	he	258	" Now , I add this small quantity of blood to a litre of water . You perceive that the resulting mixture has the appearance of pure water . The proportion of blood can not be more than one in a million . I have no doubt , however , that we shall be able to obtain the characteristic reaction . "
2308	2313	2314	2314	he	258	" Ha ! ha ! "
2333	2341	2314	2314	he	258	" What do you think of that ? "
2342	2352	2353	2353	I	0	" It seems to be a very delicate test , "
2356	2436	2314	2314	he	258	" Beautiful ! beautiful ! The old Guiacum test was very clumsy and uncertain . So is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles . The latter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old . Now , this appears to act as well whether the blood is old or new . Had this test been invented , there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who would long ago have paid the penalty of their crimes . "
2437	2440	2441	2441	I	0	" Indeed ! "
2444	2545	2314	2314	he	258	" Criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point . A man is suspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed . His linen or clothes are examined , and brownish stains discovered upon them . Are they blood stains , or mud stains , or rust stains , or fruit stains , or what are they ? That is a question which has puzzled many an expert , and why ? Because there was no reliable test . Now we have the Sherlock Holmes ' test , and there will no longer be any difficulty . "
2576	2583	2584	2584	I	0	" You are to be congratulated , "
2593	2657	2551	2551	he	258	" There was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year . He would certainly have been hung had this test been in existence . Then there was Mason of Bradford , and the notorious Muller , and Lefevre of Montpellier , and Samson of New Orleans . I could name a score of cases in which it would have been decisive . "
2658	2669	2671	2671	Stamford	107	" You seem to be a walking calendar of crime , "
2676	2697	2671	2671	Stamford	107	" You might start a paper on those lines . Call it the ' Police News of the Past . ' "
2698	2709	2711	2712	Sherlock Holmes	110	" Very interesting reading it might be made , too , "
2727	2734	2735	2735	he	110	" I have to be careful , "
2745	2755	2735	2735	he	110	" for I dabble with poisons a good deal . "
2786	2793	2795	2795	Stamford	107	" We came here on business , "
2818	2854	2815	2815	his	107	" My friend here wants to take diggings , and as you were complaining that you could get no one to go halves with you , I thought that I had better bring you together . "
2869	2881	2882	2882	he	110	" I have my eye on a suite in Baker Street , "
2885	2908	2882	2882	he	110	" which would suit us down to the ground . You do n't mind the smell of strong tobacco , I hope ? "
2909	2919	2920	2920	I	0	" I always smoke ' ship 's ' myself , "
2923	2945	2882	2882	he	110	" That 's good enough . I generally have chemicals about , and occasionally do experiments . Would that annoy you ? "
2946	2951	2882	2882	he	110	" By no means . "
2952	3035	2882	2882	he	110	" Let me see - what are my other shortcomings . I get in the dumps at times , and do n't open my mouth for days on end . You must not think I am sulky when I do that . Just let me alone , and I 'll soon be right . What have you to confess now ? It 's just as well for two fellows to know the worst of one another before they begin to live together . "
3044	3051	3052	3052	I	0	" I keep a bull pup , "
3055	3104	3052	3052	I	0	" and I object to rows because my nerves are shaken , and I get up at all sorts of ungodly hours , and I am extremely lazy . I have another set of vices when I 'm well , but those are the principal ones at present . "
3105	3118	3119	3119	he	264	" Do you include violin - playing in your category of rows ? "
3124	3131	3132	3132	I	0	" It depends on the player , "
3135	3155	3132	3132	I	0	" A well - played violin is a treat for the gods - a badly - played one - - "
3156	3164	3165	3165	he	264	" Oh , that 's all right , "
3173	3195	3165	3165	he	264	" I think we may consider the thing as settled - that is , if the rooms are agreeable to you . "
3196	3203	3132	3132	I	0	" When shall we see them ? "
3204	3224	3225	3225	he	264	" Call for me here at noon to - morrow , and we 'll go together and settle everything , "
3228	3235	3237	3237	I	0	" All right - noon exactly , "
3259	3264	3265	3265	I	0	" By the way , "
3275	3289	3265	3265	I	0	" how the deuce did he know that I had come from Afghanistan ? "
3297	3305	3306	3306	he	264	" That 's just his little peculiarity , "
3309	3324	3306	3306	he	264	" A good many people have wanted to know how he finds things out . "
3325	3333	3334	3334	I	0	" Oh ! a mystery is it ? "
3341	3371	3334	3334	I	0	" This is very piquant . I am much obliged to you for bringing us together . ' The proper study of mankind is man , ' you know . "
3372	3380	3381	3381	Stamford	107	" You must study him , then , "
3392	3420	3385	3385	he	107	" You 'll find him a knotty problem , though . I 'll wager he learns more about you than you about him . Good - bye . "
3421	3426	3427	3427	I	0	" Good - bye , "
4333	4340	4341	4341	he	287	" You appear to be astonished , "
4351	4367	4341	4341	he	287	" Now that I do know it I shall do my best to forget it . "
4368	4373	4341	4341	he	287	" To forget it ! "
4374	4378	4379	4379	he	287	" You see , "
4382	4578	4379	4379	he	287	" I consider that a man 's brain originally is like a little empty attic , and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose . A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across , so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out , or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it . Now the skilful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain - attic . He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work , but of these he has a large assortment , and all in the most perfect order . It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent . Depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before . It is of the highest importance , therefore , not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones . "
4579	4585	4586	4586	I	0	" But the Solar System ! "
4589	4598	4599	4599	he	297	" What the deuce is it to me ? "
4603	4634	4599	4599	he	297	" you say that we go round the sun . If we went round the moon it would not make a pennyworth of difference to me or to my work . "
4965	4992	4993	4993	I	0	" If I can only find what the fellow is driving at by reconciling all these accomplishments , and discovering a calling which needs them all , "
4998	5010	4993	4993	I	0	" I may as well give up the attempt at once . "
5430	5443	5444	5444	he	110	" I have to use this room as a place of business , "
5447	5455	5444	5444	he	110	" and these people are my clients . "
5652	5658	5666	5668	an observant man	320	" The Book of Life , "
5811	5818	5820	5821	the writer	321	" From a drop of water , "
5823	6069	5820	5821	the writer	321	" a logician could infer the possibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard of one or the other . So all life is a great chain , the nature of which is known whenever we are shown a single link of it . Like all other arts , the Science of Deduction and Analysis is one which can only be acquired by long and patient study nor , is life long enough to allow any mortal to attain the highest possible perfection in it . Before turning to those moral and mental aspects of the matter which present the greatest difficulties , let the enquirer begin by mastering more elementary problems . Let him , on meeting a fellow - mortal , learn at a glance to distinguish the history of the man , and the trade or profession to which he belongs . Puerile as such an exercise may seem , it sharpens the faculties of observation , and teaches one where to look and what to look for . By a man 's finger nails , by his coat - sleeve , by his boot , by his trouser knees , by the callosities of his forefinger and thumb , by his expression , by his shirt cuffs - by each of these things a man 's calling is plainly revealed . That all united should fail to enlighten the competent enquirer in any case is almost inconceivable . "
6070	6075	6076	6076	I	0	" What ineffable twaddle ! "
6087	6097	6076	6076	I	0	" I never read such rubbish in my life . "
6098	6103	6105	6106	Sherlock Holmes	110	" What is it ? "
6108	6114	6115	6115	I	0	" Why , this article , "
6133	6233	6115	6115	I	0	" I see that you have read it since you have marked it . I do n't deny that it is smartly written . It irritates me though . It is evidently the theory of some arm - chair lounger who evolves all these neat little paradoxes in the seclusion of his own study . It is not practical . I should like to see him clapped down in a third class carriage on the Underground , and asked to give the trades of all his fellow - travellers . I would lay a thousand to one against him . "
6234	6241	6242	6243	Sherlock Holmes	110	" You would lose your money , "
6247	6257	6242	6243	Sherlock Holmes	110	" As for the article I wrote it myself . "
6258	6261	6115	6115	I	0	" You ! "
6262	6311	6242	6243	Sherlock Holmes	110	" Yes , I have a turn both for observation and for deduction . The theories which I have expressed there , and which appear to you to be so chimerical are really extremely practical - so practical that I depend upon them for my bread and cheese . "
6312	6316	6317	6317	I	0	" And how ? "
6321	6490	6242	6243	Sherlock Holmes	110	" Well , I have a trade of my own . I suppose I am the only one in the world . I 'm a consulting detective , if you can understand what that is . Here in London we have lots of Government detectives and lots of private ones . When these fellows are at fault they come to me , and I manage to put them on the right scent . They lay all the evidence before me , and I am generally able , by the help of my knowledge of the history of crime , to set them straight . There is a strong family resemblance about misdeeds , and if you have all the details of a thousand at your finger ends , it is odd if you ca n't unravel the thousand and first . Lestrade is a well - known detective . He got himself into a fog recently over a forgery case , and that was what brought him here . "
6491	6497	6242	6243	Sherlock Holmes	110	" And these other people ? "
6498	6545	6242	6243	Sherlock Holmes	110	" They are mostly sent on by private inquiry agencies . They are all people who are in trouble about something , and want a little enlightening . I listen to their story , they listen to my comments , and then I pocket my fee . "
6546	6554	6555	6555	I	0	" But do you mean to say , "
6558	6586	6555	6555	I	0	" that without leaving your room you can unravel some knot which other men can make nothing of , although they have seen every detail for themselves ? "
6587	6701	6242	6243	Sherlock Holmes	110	" Quite so . I have a kind of intuition that way . Now and again a case turns up which is a little more complex . Then I have to bustle about and see things with my own eyes . You see I have a lot of special knowledge which I apply to the problem , and which facilitates matters wonderfully . Those rules of deduction laid down in that article which aroused your scorn , are invaluable to me in practical work . Observation with me is second nature . You appeared to be surprised when I told you , on our first meeting , that you had come from Afghanistan . "
6702	6710	6555	6555	I	0	" You were told , no doubt . "
6711	6903	6242	6243	Sherlock Holmes	110	" Nothing of the sort . I _ knew _ you came from Afghanistan . From long habit the train of thoughts ran so swiftly through my mind , that I arrived at the conclusion without being conscious of intermediate steps . There were such steps , however . The train of reasoning ran , ' Here is a gentleman of a medical type , but with the air of a military man . Clearly an army doctor , then . He has just come from the tropics , for his face is dark , and that is not the natural tint of his skin , for his wrists are fair . He has undergone hardship and sickness , as his haggard face says clearly . His left arm has been injured . He holds it in a stiff and unnatural manner . Where in the tropics could an English army doctor have seen much hardship and got his arm wounded ? Clearly in Afghanistan . ' The whole train of thought did not occupy a second . I then remarked that you came from Afghanistan , and you were astonished . "
6904	6914	6915	6915	I	0	" It is simple enough as you explain it , "
6920	6944	6915	6915	I	0	" You remind me of Edgar Allen Poe 's Dupin . I had no idea that such individuals did exist outside of stories . "
6953	6969	6970	6970	he	110	" No doubt you think that you are complimenting me in comparing me to Dupin , "
6973	7042	6970	6970	he	110	" Now , in my opinion , Dupin was a very inferior fellow . That trick of his of breaking in on his friends ' thoughts with an apropos remark after a quarter of an hour 's silence is really very showy and superficial . He had some analytical genius , no doubt ; but he was by no means such a phenomenon as Poe appeared to imagine . "
7043	7051	7052	7052	I	0	" Have you read Gaboriau 's works ? "
7055	7067	7052	7052	I	0	" Does Lecoq come up to your idea of a detective ? "
7073	7080	7081	7081	he	110	" Lecoq was a miserable bungler , "
7089	7157	7081	7081	he	110	" he had only one thing to recommend him , and that was his energy . That book made me positively ill . The question was how to identify an unknown prisoner . I could have done it in twenty - four hours . Lecoq took six months or so . It might be made a text - book for detectives to teach them what to avoid . "
7192	7200	7201	7201	I	0	" This fellow may be very clever , "
7206	7214	7201	7201	I	0	" but he is certainly very conceited . "
7215	7227	7228	7228	he	110	" There are no crimes and no criminals in these days , "
7233	7326	7228	7228	he	110	" What is the use of having brains in our profession . I know well that I have it in me to make my name famous . No man lives or has ever lived who has brought the same amount of study and of natural talent to the detection of crime which I have done . And what is the result ? There is no crime to detect , or , at most , some bungling villainy with a motive so transparent that even a Scotland Yard official can see through it . "
7347	7357	7358	7358	I	0	" I wonder what that fellow is looking for ? "
7407	7416	7418	7419	Sherlock Holmes	110	" You mean the retired sergeant of Marines , "
7421	7426	7428	7428	I	0	" Brag and bounce ! "
7432	7443	7428	7428	I	0	" He knows that I can not verify his guess . "
7493	7499	7500	7500	he	330	" For Mr. Sherlock Holmes , "
7538	7546	7547	7547	I	0	" May I ask , my lad , "
7555	7562	7547	7547	I	0	" what your trade may be ? "
7563	7568	7569	7569	he	330	" Commissionaire , sir , "
7574	7580	7569	7569	he	330	" Uniform away for repairs . "
7581	7586	7587	7587	I	0	" And you were ? "
7599	7619	7620	7620	He	330	" A sergeant , sir , Royal Marine Light Infantry , sir . No answer ? Right , sir . "
7741	7751	7752	7752	I	0	" How in the world did you deduce that ? "
7755	7759	7761	7761	he	330	" Deduce what ? "
7765	7777	7725	7725	his	330	" Why , that he was a retired sergeant of Marines . "
7778	7786	7787	7787	he	330	" I have no time for trifles , "
7797	7834	7787	7787	he	330	" Excuse my rudeness . You broke the thread of my thoughts ; but perhaps it is as well . So you actually were not able to see that that man was a sergeant of Marines ? "
7835	7840	7725	7725	his	330	" No , indeed . "
7841	7998	7787	7787	he	330	" It was easier to know it than to explain why I knew it . If you were asked to prove that two and two made four , you might find some difficulty , and yet you are quite sure of the fact . Even across the street I could see a great blue anchor tattooed on the back of the fellow 's hand . That smacked of the sea . He had a military carriage , however , and regulation side whiskers . There we have the marine . He was a man with some amount of self - importance and a certain air of command . You must have observed the way in which he held his head and swung his cane . A steady , respectable , middle - aged man , too , on the face of him - all facts which led me to believe that he had been a sergeant . "
7999	8002	8003	8003	I	0	" Wonderful ! "
8006	8009	8011	8011	Holmes	110	" Commonplace , "
8030	8052	8053	8053	He	110	" I said just now that there were no criminals . It appears that I am wrong - look at this ! "
8065	8068	8069	8069	I	0	" Why , "
8080	8085	8073	8073	I	0	" this is terrible ! "
8086	8099	8100	8100	he	110	" It does seem to be a little out of the common , "
8105	8115	8100	8100	he	110	" Would you mind reading it to me aloud ? "
8126	8134	8121	8121	I	0	" MY DEAR MR . SHERLOCK HOLMES , -
8135	8359	8073	8073	I	0	" There has been a bad business during the night at 3 , Lauriston Gardens , off the Brixton Road . Our man on the beat saw a light there about two in the morning , and as the house was an empty one , suspected that something was amiss . He found the door open , and in the front room , which is bare of furniture , discovered the body of a gentleman , well dressed , and having cards in his pocket bearing the name of ' Enoch J. Drebber , Cleveland , Ohio , U.S.A. ' There had been no robbery , nor is there any evidence as to how the man met his death . There are marks of blood in the room , but there is no wound upon his person . We are at a loss as to how he came into the empty house ; indeed , the whole affair is a puzzler . If you can come round to the house any time before twelve , you will find me there . I have left everything _ in statu quo _ until I hear from you . If you are unable to come I shall give you fuller details , and would esteem it a great kindness if you would favour me with your opinion .
8363	8367	8360	8360	Yours	338	" TOBIAS GREGSON . "
8368	8378	8379	8380	my friend	334	" Gregson is the smartest of the Scotland Yarders , "
8383	8446	8379	8380	my friend	334	" he and Lestrade are the pick of a bad lot . They are both quick and energetic , but conventional - shockingly so . They have their knives into one another , too . They are as jealous as a pair of professional beauties . There will be some fun over this case if they are both put upon the scent . "
8460	8471	8472	8472	I	0	" Surely there is not a moment to be lost , "
8475	8485	8472	8472	I	0	" shall I go and order you a cab ? "
8486	8530	8360	8360	Yours	338	" I 'm not sure about whether I shall go . I am the most incurably lazy devil that ever stood in shoe leather - that is , when the fit is on me , for I can be spry enough at times . "
8531	8547	8472	8472	I	0	" Why , it is just such a chance as you have been longing for . "
8548	8592	8360	8360	Yours	338	" My dear fellow , what does it matter to me . Supposing I unravel the whole matter , you may be sure that Gregson , Lestrade , and Co. will pocket all the credit . That comes of being an unofficial personage . "
8593	8602	8472	8472	I	0	" But he begs you to help him . "
8603	8675	8360	8360	Yours	338	" Yes . He knows that I am his superior , and acknowledges it to me ; but he would cut his tongue out before he would own it to any third person . However , we may as well go and have a look . I shall work it out on my own hook . I may have a laugh at them if I have nothing else . Come on ! "
8700	8705	8706	8706	he	341	" Get your hat , "
8709	8716	8472	8472	I	0	" You wish me to come ? "
8717	8728	8472	8472	I	0	" Yes , if you have nothing better to do . "
8831	8846	8847	8847	I	0	" You do n't seem to give much thought to the matter in hand , "
8858	8863	8864	8864	he	110	" No data yet , "
8867	8887	8864	8864	he	110	" It is a capital mistake to theorize before you have all the evidence . It biases the judgment . "
8888	8896	8897	8897	I	0	" You will have your data soon , "
8905	8926	8897	8897	I	0	" this is the Brixton Road , and that is the house , if I am not very much mistaken . "
8927	8938	8951	8951	he	110	" So it is . Stop , driver , stop ! "
9025	9028	9417	9417	he	366	" To Let "
9406	9416	9417	9417	he	366	" It is indeed kind of you to come , "
9420	9428	9434	9435	my friend	334	" I have had everything left untouched . "
9429	9433	9434	9435	my friend	334	" Except that ! "
9443	9479	9493	9494	the detective	370	" If a herd of buffaloes had passed along there could not be a greater mess . No doubt , however , you had drawn your own conclusions , Gregson , before you permitted this . "
9480	9492	9493	9494	the detective	370	" I have had so much to do inside the house , "
9498	9518	9556	9556	he	110	" My colleague , Mr. Lestrade , is here . I had relied upon him to look after this . "
9529	9555	9583	9583	he	110	" With two such men as yourself and Lestrade upon the ground , there will not be much for a third party to find out , "
9570	9582	9583	9583	he	110	" I think we have done all that can be done , "
9586	9603	9616	9617	Sherlock Holmes	110	" it 's a queer case though , and I knew your taste for such things . "
9604	9614	9583	9583	he	110	" You did not come here in a cab ? "
9619	9624	9583	9583	he	110	" No , sir . "
9625	9629	9583	9583	he	110	" Nor Lestrade ? "
9630	9635	9652	9652	he	110	" No , sir . "
9636	9647	10164	10164	he	119	" Then let us go and look at the room . "
10153	10163	10164	10164	he	119	" This case will make a stir , sir , "
10167	10181	10190	10190	Gregson	130	" It beats anything I have seen , and I am no chicken . "
10182	10188	10200	10200	Lestrade	119	" There is no clue ? "
10192	10197	10228	10228	he	110	" None at all , "
10217	10227	10249	10250	both detectives	385	" You are sure that there is no wound ? "
10244	10247	10340	10340	he	119	" Positive ! "
10252	10307	10340	10340	he	119	" Then , of course , this blood belongs to a second individual - presumably the murderer , if murder has been committed . It reminds me of the circumstances attendant on the death of Van Jansen , in Utrecht , in the year ' 34 . Do you remember the case , Gregson ? "
10308	10313	10340	10340	he	119	" No , sir . "
10314	10338	10433	10433	he	119	" Read it up - you really should . There is nothing new under the sun . It has all been done before . "
10423	10432	10403	10403	he	119	" He has not been moved at all ? "
10436	10449	10461	10461	he	119	" No more than was necessary for the purposes of our examination . "
10450	10460	10461	10461	he	119	" You can take him to the mortuary now , "
10464	10473	10537	10537	he	119	" There is nothing more to be learned . "
10528	10536	10537	10537	he	119	" There 's been a woman here , "
10540	10550	10604	10604	Gregson	130	" It 's a woman 's wedding - ring . "
10597	10602	10604	10604	Gregson	130	" This complicates matters , "
10606	10616	10629	10629	Holmes	110	" Heaven knows , they were complicated enough before . "
10617	10627	10629	10629	Holmes	110	" You 're sure it does n't simplify them ? "
10631	10651	10661	10661	Gregson	130	" There 's nothing to be learned by staring at it . What did you find in his pockets ? "
10652	10659	10661	10661	Gregson	130	" We have it all here , "
10679	10798	10629	10629	Holmes	110	" A gold watch , No . 97163 , by Barraud , of London . Gold Albert chain , very heavy and solid . Gold ring , with masonic device . Gold pin - bull - dog 's head , with rubies as eyes . Russian leather card - case , with cards of Enoch J. Drebber of Cleveland , corresponding with the E. J. D. upon the linen . No purse , but loose money to the extent of seven pounds thirteen . Pocket edition of Boccaccio 's _ Decameron _ , with name of Joseph Stangerson upon the fly - leaf . Two letters - one addressed to E. J. Drebber and one to Joseph Stangerson . "
10799	10804	10661	10661	Gregson	130	" At what address ? "
10805	10853	10629	10629	Holmes	110	" American Exchange , Strand - to be left till called for . They are both from the Guion Steamship Company , and refer to the sailing of their boats from Liverpool . It is clear that this unfortunate man was about to return to New York . "
10854	10867	10879	10879	Gregson	130	" Have you made any inquiries as to this man , Stangerson ? "
10868	10877	10879	10879	Gregson	130	" I did it at once , sir , "
10881	10911	10629	10629	Holmes	110	" I have had advertisements sent to all the newspapers , and one of my men has gone to the American Exchange , but he has not returned yet . "
10912	10919	10879	10879	Gregson	130	" Have you sent to Cleveland ? "
10920	10926	10629	10629	Holmes	110	" We telegraphed this morning . "
10927	10935	10879	10879	Gregson	130	" How did you word your inquiries ? "
10936	10958	10629	10629	Holmes	110	" We simply detailed the circumstances , and said that we should be glad of any information which could help us . "
10959	10977	10879	10879	Gregson	130	" You did not ask for particulars on any point which appeared to you to be crucial ? "
10978	10984	10629	10629	Holmes	110	" I asked about Stangerson . "
10985	11008	11021	11021	Gregson	130	" Nothing else ? Is there no circumstance on which this whole case appears to hinge ? Will you not telegraph again ? "
11009	11019	11086	11086	he	119	" I have said all I have to say , "
11081	11085	11086	11086	he	119	" Mr. Gregson , "
11089	11119	11154	11154	he	397	" I have just made a discovery of the highest importance , and one which would have been overlooked had I not made a careful examination of the walls . "
11149	11153	11154	11154	he	397	" Come here , "
11177	11183	11205	11205	he	397	" Now , stand there ! "
11199	11204	11272	11273	the detective	370	" Look at that ! "
11262	11270	11279	11280	a showman	403	" What do you think of that ? "
11285	11389	11407	11407	Gregson	130	" This was overlooked because it was in the darkest corner of the room , and no one thought of looking there . The murderer has written it with his or her own blood . See this smear where it has trickled down the wall ! That disposes of the idea of suicide anyhow . Why was that corner chosen to write it on ? I will tell you . See that candle on the mantelpiece . It was lit at the time , and if it was lit this corner would be the brightest instead of the darkest portion of the wall . "
11390	11405	11279	11280	a showman	403	" And what does it mean now that you _ have _ found it ? "
11413	11509	11519	11520	my companion	243	" Mean ? Why , it means that the writer was going to put the female name Rachel , but was disturbed before he or she had time to finish . You mark my words , when this case comes to be cleared up you will find that a woman named Rachel has something to do with it . It 's all very well for you to laugh , Mr. Sherlock Holmes . You may be very smart and clever , but the old hound is the best , when all is said and done . "
11510	11517	11519	11520	my companion	243	" I really beg your pardon ! "
11538	11600	11863	11863	he	397	" You certainly have the credit of being the first of us to find this out , and , as you say , it bears every mark of having been written by the other participant in last night 's mystery . I have not had time to examine this room yet , but with your permission I shall do so now . "
11849	11862	11863	11863	he	397	" They say that genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains , "
11869	11885	11946	11946	they	409	" It 's a very bad definition , but it does apply to detective work . "
11935	11945	11973	11974	my friend	334	" What do you think of it , sir ? "
11950	11971	11973	11974	my friend	334	" It would be robbing you of the credit of the case if I was to presume to help you , "
11976	11994	12021	12021	he	397	" You are doing so well now that it would be a pity for anyone to interfere . "
12008	12020	12021	12021	he	397	" If you will let me know how your investigations go , "
12024	12062	12076	12076	he	119	" I shall be happy to give you any help I can . In the meantime I should like to speak to the constable who found the body . Can you give me his name and address ? "
12071	12075	12076	12076	he	119	" John Rance , "
12079	12100	12116	12116	he	119	" He is off duty now . You will find him at 46 , Audley Court , Kennington Park Gate . "
12109	12115	12143	12143	he	119	" Come along , Doctor , "
12119	12142	12143	12143	he	119	" we shall go and look him up . I 'll tell you one thing which may help you in the case , "
12152	12270	12297	12298	the former	414	" There has been murder done , and the murderer was a man . He was more than six feet high , was in the prime of life , had small feet for his height , wore coarse , square - toed boots and smoked a Trichinopoly cigar . He came here with his victim in a four - wheeled cab , which was drawn by a horse with three old shoes and one new one on his off fore leg . In all probability the murderer had a florid face , and the finger - nails of his right hand were remarkably long . These are only a few indications , but they may assist you . "
12283	12295	12305	12306	Sherlock Holmes	110	" If this man was murdered , how was it done ? "
12300	12303	12321	12321	he	110	" Poison , "
12313	12320	12321	12321	he	110	" One other thing , Lestrade , "
12330	12354	12435	12435	he	110	" ' Rache , ' is the German for ' revenge ; ' so do n't lose your time looking for Miss Rachel . "
12425	12434	12435	12435	he	110	" There is nothing like first hand evidence , "
12438	12469	12479	12479	I.	0	" as a matter of fact , my mind is entirely made up upon the case , but still we may as well learn all that is to be learned . "
12470	12477	12479	12479	I.	0	" You amaze me , Holmes , "
12480	12500	12511	12511	he	110	" Surely you are not as sure as you pretend to be of all those particulars which you gave . "
12501	12510	12511	12511	he	110	" There 's no room for a mistake , "
12514	12668	12677	12677	I	0	" The very first thing which I observed on arriving there was that a cab had made two ruts with its wheels close to the curb . Now , up to last night , we have had no rain for a week , so that those wheels which left such a deep impression must have been there during the night . There were the marks of the horse 's hoofs , too , the outline of one of which was far more clearly cut than that of the other three , showing that that was a new shoe . Since the cab was there after the rain began , and was not there at any time during the morning - I have Gregson 's word for that - it follows that it must have been there during the night , and , therefore , that it brought those two individuals to the house . "
12669	12675	12677	12677	I	0	" That seems simple enough , "
12679	12689	12511	12511	he	110	" but how about the other man 's height ? "
12690	12801	12808	12808	I	0	" Why , the height of a man , in nine cases out of ten , can be told from the length of his stride . It is a simple calculation enough , though there is no use my boring you with figures . I had this fellow 's stride both on the clay outside and on the dust within . Then I had a way of checking my calculation . When a man writes on a wall , his instinct leads him to write about the level of his own eyes . Now that writing was just over six feet from the ground . It was child 's play . "
12802	12807	12511	12511	he	110	" And his age ? "
12811	12915	12925	12925	I	0	" Well , if a man can stride four and a - half feet without the smallest effort , he ca n't be quite in the sere and yellow . That was the breadth of a puddle on the garden walk which he had evidently walked across . Patent - leather boots had gone round , and Square - toes had hopped over . There is no mystery about it at all . I am simply applying to ordinary life a few of those precepts of observation and deduction which I advocated in that article . Is there anything else that puzzles you ? "
12916	12924	12511	12511	he	110	" The finger nails and the Trichinopoly , "
12928	13070	13078	13078	I	0	" The writing on the wall was done with a man 's forefinger dipped in blood . My glass allowed me to observe that the plaster was slightly scratched in doing it , which would not have been the case if the man 's nail had been trimmed . I gathered up some scattered ash from the floor . It was dark in colour and flakey - such an ash as is only made by a Trichinopoly . I have made a special study of cigar ashes - in fact , I have written a monograph upon the subject . I flatter myself that I can distinguish at a glance the ash of any known brand , either of cigar or of tobacco . It is just in such details that the skilled detective differs from the Gregson and Lestrade type . "
13071	13077	12511	12511	he	110	" And the florid face ? "
13081	13115	13133	13133	I	0	" Ah , that was a more daring shot , though I have no doubt that I was right . You must not ask me that at the present state of the affair . "
13124	13132	13133	13133	I	0	" My head is in a whirl , "
13136	13250	13270	13270	he	243	" the more one thinks of it the more mysterious it grows . How came these two men - if there were two men - into an empty house ? What has become of the cabman who drove them ? How could one man compel another to take poison ? Where did the blood come from ? What was the object of the murderer , since robbery had no part in it ? How came the woman 's ring there ? Above all , why should the second man write up the German word RACHE before decamping ? I confess that I can not see any possible way of reconciling all these facts . "
13256	13269	13270	13270	he	243	" You sum up the difficulties of the situation succinctly and well , "
13273	13454	13463	13463	I	0	" There is much that is still obscure , though I have quite made up my mind on the main facts . As to poor Lestrade 's discovery it was simply a blind intended to put the police upon a wrong track , by suggesting Socialism and secret societies . It was not done by a German . The A , if you noticed , was printed somewhat after the German fashion . Now , a real German invariably prints in the Latin character , so that we may safely say that this was not written by one , but by a clumsy imitator who overdid his part . It was simply a ruse to divert inquiry into a wrong channel . I 'm not going to tell you much more of the case , Doctor . You know a conjuror gets no credit when once he has explained his trick , and if I show you too much of my method of working , you will come to the conclusion that I am a very ordinary individual after all . "
13455	13462	13463	13463	I	0	" I shall never do that , "
13466	13486	13543	13543	he	243	" you have brought detection as near an exact science as it ever will be brought in this world . "
13533	13542	13543	13543	he	243	" I 'll tell you one other thing , "
13546	13724	13774	13774	he	428	" Patent - leathers and Square - toes came in the same cab , and they walked down the pathway together as friendly as possible - arm - in - arm , in all probability . When they got inside they walked up and down the room - or rather , Patent - leathers stood still while Square - toes walked up and down . I could read all that in the dust ; and I could read that as he walked he grew more and more excited . That is shown by the increased length of his strides . He was talking all the while , and working himself up , no doubt , into a fury . Then the tragedy occurred . I 've told you all I know myself now , for the rest is mere surmise and conjecture . We have a good working basis , however , on which to start . We must hurry up , for I want to go to Halle 's concert to hear Norman Neruda this afternoon . "
13765	13773	13774	13774	he	428	" That 's Audley Court in there , "
13791	13802	13922	13922	he	434	" You 'll find me here when you come back . "
13912	13921	13957	13957	he	110	" I made my report at the office , "
13940	13956	13974	13975	the constable	434	" We thought that we should like to hear it all from your own lips , "
13960	13973	13974	13975	the constable	434	" I shall be most happy to tell you anything I can , "
13986	14001	14036	14036	he	132	" Just let us hear it all in your own way as it occurred . "
14025	14035	14036	14036	he	132	" I 'll tell it ye from the beginning , "
14039	14288	14303	14304	my companion	243	" My time is from ten at night to six in the morning . At eleven there was a fight at the ' White Hart ' ; but bar that all was quiet enough on the beat . At one o'clock it began to rain , and I met Harry Murcher - him who has the Holland Grove beat - and we stood together at the corner of Henrietta Street a - talkin ' . Presently - maybe about two or a little after - I thought I would take a look round and see that all was right down the Brixton Road . It was precious dirty and lonely . Not a soul did I meet all the way down , though a cab or two went past me . I was a strollin ' down , thinkin ' between ourselves how uncommon handy a four of gin hot would be , when suddenly the glint of a light caught my eye in the window of that same house . Now , I knew that them two houses in Lauriston Gardens was empty on account of him that owns them who wo n't have the drains seen to , though the very last tenant what lived in one of them died o ' typhoid fever . I was knocked all in a heap therefore at seeing a light in the window , and I suspected as something was wrong . When I got to the door - - "
14289	14302	14303	14304	my companion	243	" You stopped , and then walked back to the garden gate , "
14307	14315	14345	14345	he	132	" What did you do that for ? "
14335	14344	14345	14345	he	132	" Why , that 's true , sir , "
14348	14469	14596	14597	John Rance	132	" though how you come to know it , Heaven only knows . Ye see , when I got up to the door it was so still and so lonesome , that I thought I 'd be none the worse for some one with me . I ai n't afeared of anything on this side o ' the grave ; but I thought that maybe it was him that died o ' the typhoid inspecting the drains what killed him . The thought gave me a kind o ' turn , and I walked back to the gate to see if I could see Murcher 's lantern , but there was n't no sign of him nor of anyone else . "
14470	14479	14345	14345	he	132	" There was no one in the street ? "
14480	14553	14596	14597	John Rance	132	" Not a livin ' soul , sir , nor as much as a dog . Then I pulled myself together and went back and pushed the door open . All was quiet inside , so I went into the room where the light was a - burnin ' . There was a candle flickerin ' on the mantelpiece - a red wax one - and by its light I saw - - "
14554	14595	14623	14623	he	132	" Yes , I know all that you saw . You walked round the room several times , and you knelt down by the body , and then you walked through and tried the kitchen door , and then - - "
14612	14622	14623	14623	he	132	" Where was you hid to see all that ? "
14626	14641	14666	14666	he	132	" It seems to me that you knows a deal more than you should . "
14655	14665	14666	14666	he	132	" Do n't get arresting me for the murder , "
14669	14702	14703	14703	Rance	132	" I am one of the hounds and not the wolf ; Mr. Gregson or Mr. Lestrade will answer for that . Go on , though . What did you do next ? "
14715	14737	14772	14773	The constable	434	" I went back to the gate and sounded my whistle . That brought Murcher and two more to the spot . "
14738	14745	14703	14703	Rance	132	" Was the street empty then ? "
14746	14764	14772	14773	The constable	434	" Well , it was , as far as anybody that could be of any good goes . "
14765	14771	14794	14794	he	434	" What do you mean ? "
14781	14793	14794	14794	he	434	" I 've seen many a drunk chap in my time , "
14797	14862	14874	14875	Sherlock Holmes	110	" but never anyone so cryin ' drunk as that cove . He was at the gate when I came out , a - leanin ' up agin the railings , and a - singin ' at the pitch o ' his lungs about Columbine 's New - fangled Banner , or some such stuff . He could n't stand , far less help . "
14863	14872	14900	14900	he	132	" What sort of a man was he ? "
14888	14899	14900	14900	he	132	" He was an uncommon drunk sort o ' man , "
14903	14922	14937	14937	Holmes	110	" He 'd ha ' found hisself in the station if we had n't been so took up . "
14923	14936	14937	14937	Holmes	110	" His face - his dress - did n't you notice them ? "
14942	14984	14992	14992	Holmes	110	" I should think I did notice them , seeing that I had to prop him up - me and Murcher between us . He was a long chap , with a red face , the lower part muffled round - - "
14985	14990	14992	14992	Holmes	110	" That will do , "
14994	15000	15014	15015	the policeman	440	" What became of him ? "
15001	15013	15014	15015	the policeman	440	" We 'd enough to do without lookin ' after him , "
15023	15035	14937	14937	Holmes	110	" I 'll wager he found his way home all right . "
15036	15042	15014	15015	the policeman	440	" How was he dressed ? "
15043	15048	14937	14937	Holmes	110	" A brown overcoat . "
15049	15058	15014	15015	the policeman	440	" Had he a whip in his hand ? "
15059	15065	15076	15077	my companion	243	" A whip - no . "
15066	15074	15076	15077	my companion	243	" He must have left it behind , "
15079	15093	15014	15015	the policeman	440	" You did n't happen to see or hear a cab after that ? "
15094	15097	15117	15117	his	243	" No . "
15098	15108	15117	15117	his	243	" There 's a half - sovereign for you , "
15120	15208	15232	15232	Holmes	110	" I am afraid , Rance , that you will never rise in the force . That head of yours should be for use as well as ornament . You might have gained your sergeant 's stripes last night . The man whom you held in your hands is the man who holds the clue of this mystery , and whom we are seeking . There is no use of arguing about it now ; I tell you that it is so . Come along , Doctor . "
15226	15231	15232	15232	Holmes	110	" The blundering fool , "
15245	15267	15209	15209	We	443	" Just to think of his having such an incomparable bit of good luck , and not taking advantage of it . "
15268	15319	15232	15232	Holmes	110	" I am rather in the dark still . It is true that the description of this man tallies with your idea of the second party in this mystery . But why should he come back to the house after leaving it ? That is not the way of criminals . "
15320	15500	15925	15925	he	110	" The ring , man , the ring : that was what he came back for . If we have no other way of catching him , we can always bait our line with the ring . I shall have him , Doctor - I 'll lay you two to one that I have him . I must thank you for it all . I might not have gone but for you , and so have missed the finest study I ever came across : a study in scarlet , eh ? Why should n't we use a little art jargon . There 's the scarlet thread of murder running through the colourless skein of life , and our duty is to unravel it , and isolate it , and expose every inch of it . And now for lunch , and then for Norman Neruda . Her attack and her bowing are splendid . What 's that little thing of Chopin 's she plays so magnificently : Tra - la - la - lira - lira - lay . "
15919	15924	15925	15925	he	110	" It was magnificent , "
15934	16000	16010	16010	I	0	" Do you remember what Darwin says about music ? He claims that the power of producing and appreciating it existed among the human race long before the power of speech was arrived at . Perhaps that is why we are so subtly influenced by it . There are vague memories in our souls of those misty centuries when the world was in its childhood . "
16001	16009	16031	16031	he	110	" That 's rather a broad idea , "
16013	16030	16031	16031	he	110	" One 's ideas must be as broad as Nature if they are to interpret Nature , "
16034	16055	16066	16066	I	0	" What 's the matter ? You 're not looking quite yourself . This Brixton Road affair has upset you . "
16056	16065	16066	16066	I	0	" To tell the truth , it has , "
16069	16098	16031	16031	he	110	" I ought to be more case - hardened after my Afghan experiences . I saw my own comrades hacked to pieces at Maiwand without losing my nerve . "
16099	16132	16066	16066	I	0	" I can understand . There is a mystery about this which stimulates the imagination ; where there is no imagination there is no horror . Have you seen the evening paper ? "
16133	16136	16031	16031	he	110	" No . "
16137	16181	16066	16066	I	0	" It gives a fairly good account of the affair . It does not mention the fact that when the man was raised up , a woman 's wedding ring fell upon the floor . It is just as well it does not . "
16182	16185	16193	16193	he	110	" Why ? "
16186	16192	16193	16193	he	110	" Look at this advertisement , "
16196	16211	16212	16212	He	110	" I had one sent to every paper this morning immediately after the affair . "
16234	16236	16066	16066	I	0	" Found "
16239	16247	16066	16066	I	0	" In Brixton Road , this morning , "
16251	16289	16298	16298	he	110	" a plain gold wedding ring , found in the roadway between the ' White Hart ' Tavern and Holland Grove . Apply Dr. Watson , 221B , Baker Street , between eight and nine this evening . "
16290	16297	16298	16298	he	110	" Excuse my using your name , "
16301	16323	16331	16331	I	0	" If I used my own some of these dunderheads would recognize it , and want to meddle in the affair . "
16324	16330	16331	16331	I	0	" That is all right , "
16334	16345	16355	16355	he	110	" But supposing anyone applies , I have no ring . "
16346	16353	16355	16355	he	110	" Oh yes , you have , "
16361	16374	16298	16298	he	110	" This will do very well . It is almost a facsimile . "
16375	16386	16355	16355	he	110	" And who do you expect will answer this advertisement . "
16387	16417	16298	16298	he	110	" Why , the man in the brown coat - our florid friend with the square toes . If he does not come himself he will send an accomplice . "
16418	16428	16355	16355	he	110	" Would he not consider it as too dangerous ? "
16429	16670	16676	16676	I	0	" Not at all . If my view of the case is correct , and I have every reason to believe that it is , this man would rather risk anything than lose the ring . According to my notion he dropped it while stooping over Drebber 's body , and did not miss it at the time . After leaving the house he discovered his loss and hurried back , but found the police already in possession , owing to his own folly in leaving the candle burning . He had to pretend to be drunk in order to allay the suspicions which might have been aroused by his appearance at the gate . Now put yourself in that man 's place . On thinking the matter over , it must have occurred to him that it was possible that he had lost the ring in the road after leaving the house . What would he do , then ? He would eagerly look out for the evening papers in the hope of seeing it among the articles found . His eye , of course , would light upon this . He would be overjoyed . Why should he fear a trap ? There would be no reason in his eyes why the finding of the ring should be connected with the murder . He would come . He will come . You shall see him within an hour ? "
16671	16675	16355	16355	he	110	" And then ? "
16679	16697	16355	16355	he	110	" Oh , you can leave me to deal with him then . Have you any arms ? "
16698	16710	16355	16355	he	110	" I have my old service revolver and a few cartridges . "
16711	16746	16789	16789	he	110	" You had better clean it and load it . He will be a desperate man , and though I shall take him unawares , it is as well to be ready for anything . "
16783	16788	16789	16789	he	110	" The plot thickens , "
16796	16818	16825	16825	I	0	" I have just had an answer to my American telegram . My view of the case is the correct one . "
16819	16824	16841	16841	he	110	" And that is ? "
16829	16840	16841	16841	he	110	" My fiddle would be the better for new strings , "
16844	16881	16890	16890	I	0	" Put your pistol in your pocket . When the fellow comes speak to him in an ordinary way . Leave the rest to me . Do n't frighten him by looking at him too hard . "
16882	16889	16789	16789	he	110	" It is eight o'clock now , "
16898	16984	16841	16841	he	110	" Yes . He will probably be here in a few minutes . Open the door slightly . That will do . Now put the key on the inside . Thank you ! This is a queer old book I picked up at a stall yesterday - ' De Jure inter Gentes ' - published in Latin at Liege in the Lowlands , in 1642 . Charles ' head was still firm on his shoulders when this little brown - backed volume was struck off . "
16985	16991	16789	16789	he	110	" Who is the printer ? "
16992	17056	17125	17126	the servant	463	" Philippe de Croy , whoever he may have been . On the fly - leaf , in very faded ink , is written ' Ex libris Guliolmi Whyte . ' I wonder who William Whyte was . Some pragmatical seventeenth century lawyer , I suppose . His writing has a legal twist about it . Here comes our man , I think . "

17320	17414	17422	17422	I	0	" a gold wedding ring in the Brixton Road . It belongs to my girl Sally , as was married only this time twelvemonth , which her husband is steward aboard a Union boat , and what he 'd say if he come ' ome and found her without her ring is more than I can think , he being short enough at the best o ' times , but more especially when he has the drink . If it please you , she went to the circus last night along with - - "

17437	17452	17462	17462	I	0	" Sally will be a glad woman this night . That 's the ring . "

17470	17484	17500	17501	Sherlock Holmes	110	" 13 , Duncan Street , Houndsditch . A weary way from here . "
17485	17498	17534	17534	she	474	" The Brixton Road does not lie between any circus and Houndsditch , "
17522	17533	17534	17534	she	474	" The gentleman asked me for _ my _ address , "
17537	17550	17433	17435	the old woman	474	" Sally lives in lodgings at 3 , Mayfield Place , Peckham . "
17551	17559	17534	17534	she	474	" And your name is - - ? "
17560	17620	17631	17631	I	0	" My name is Sawyer - her 's is Dennis , which Tom Dennis married her - and a smart , clean lad , too , as long as he 's at sea , and no steward in the company more thought of ; but when on shore , what with the women and what with liquor shops - - "
17621	17630	17631	17631	I	0	" Here is your ring , Mrs. Sawyer , "
17643	17666	17731	17731	he	110	" it clearly belongs to your daughter , and I am glad to be able to restore it to the rightful owner . "

17736	17755	17806	17806	I	0	" she must be an accomplice , and will lead me to him . Wait up for me . "

18075	18376	18386	18386	I	0	" Oh , I do n't mind telling a story against myself . That creature had gone a little way when she began to limp and show every sign of being foot - sore . Presently she came to a halt , and hailed a four - wheeler which was passing . I managed to be close to her so as to hear the address , but I need not have been so anxious , for she sang it out loud enough to be heard at the other side of the street , ' Drive to 13 , Duncan Street , Houndsditch , ' she cried . This begins to look genuine , I thought , and having seen her safely inside , I perched myself behind . That 's an art which every detective should be an expert at . Well , away we rattled , and never drew rein until we reached the street in question . I hopped off before we came to the door , and strolled down the street in an easy , lounging way . I saw the cab pull up . The driver jumped down , and I saw him open the door and stand expectantly . Nothing came out though . When I reached him he was groping about frantically in the empty cab , and giving vent to the finest assorted collection of oaths that ever I listened to . There was no sign or trace of his passenger , and I fear it will be some time before he gets his fare . On inquiring at Number 13 we found that the house belonged to a respectable paperhanger , named Keswick , and that no one of the name either of Sawyer or Dennis had ever been heard of there . "

18392	18423	18432	18433	Sherlock Holmes	110	" that that tottering , feeble old woman was able to get out of the cab while it was in motion , without either you or the driver seeing her ? "
18424	18430	18432	18433	Sherlock Holmes	110	" Old woman be damned ! "
18437	18545	18622	18622	they	487	" We were the old women to be so taken in . It must have been a young man , and an active one , too , besides being an incomparable actor . The get - up was inimitable . He saw that he was followed , no doubt , and used this means of giving me the slip . It shows that the man we are after is not as lonely as I imagined he was , but has friends who are ready to risk something for him . Now , Doctor , you are looking done - up . Take my advice and turn in . "

19634	19647	19589	19589	Holmes	110	" Is it on this Brixton case that you are employing them ? "
19651	19720	19765	19765	he	532	" Yes ; there is a point which I wish to ascertain . It is merely a matter of time . Hullo ! we are going to hear some news now with a vengeance ! Here is Gregson coming down the road with beatitude written upon every feature of his face . Bound for us , I know . Yes , he is stopping . There he is ! "
19759	19764	19765	19765	he	532	" My dear fellow , "
19774	19789	19818	19818	he	532	" congratulate me ! I have made the whole thing as clear as day . "
19805	19817	19765	19765	he	532	" Do you mean that you are on the right track ? "
19821	19839	19875	19876	Sherlock Holmes	110	" The right track ! Why , sir , we have the man under lock and key . "
19840	19846	19862	19862	Gregson	130	" And his name is ? "
19847	19860	19902	19902	he	532	" Arthur Charpentier , sub - lieutenant in Her Majesty 's navy , "
19889	19901	19902	19902	he	532	" Take a seat , and try one of these cigars , "
19905	19924	19935	19936	the detective	370	" We are anxious to know how you managed it . Will you have some whiskey and water ? "
19925	19934	19935	19936	the detective	370	" I do n't mind if I do , "
19939	19992	20003	20003	Holmes	110	" The tremendous exertions which I have gone through during the last day or two have worn me out . Not so much bodily exertion , you understand , as the strain upon the mind . You will appreciate that , Mr. Sherlock Holmes , for we are both brain - workers . "
19993	20001	20003	20003	Holmes	110	" You do me too much honour , "
20007	20020	20058	20058	he	370	" Let us hear how you arrived at this most gratifying result . "
20050	20057	20058	20058	he	370	" The fun of it is , "
20061	20116	20040	20040	he	370	" that that fool Lestrade , who thinks himself so smart , has gone off upon the wrong track altogether . He is after the secretary Stangerson , who had no more to do with the crime than the babe unborn . I have no doubt that he has caught him by this time . "
20130	20139	20243	20243	Gregson	130	" And how did you get your clue ? "
20140	20222	20228	20228	Holmes	110	" Ah , I 'll tell you all about it . Of course , Doctor Watson , this is strictly between ourselves . The first difficulty which we had to contend with was the finding of this American 's antecedents . Some people would have waited until their advertisements were answered , or until parties came forward and volunteered information . That is not Tobias Gregson 's way of going to work . You remember the hat beside the dead man ? "
20223	20226	20228	20228	Holmes	110	" Yes , "
20230	20242	20261	20261	he	110	" by John Underwood and Sons , 129 , Camberwell Road . "
20250	20260	20261	20261	he	110	" I had no idea that you noticed that , "
20264	20270	20243	20243	Gregson	130	" Have you been there ? "
20271	20274	20280	20280	Gregson	130	" No . "
20275	20278	20280	20280	Gregson	130	" Ha ! "
20287	20301	20314	20314	Holmes	110	" you should never neglect a chance , however small it may seem . "
20302	20312	20280	20280	Gregson	130	" To a great mind , nothing is little , "
20318	20381	20390	20391	Sherlock Holmes	110	" Well , I went to Underwood , and asked him if he had sold a hat of that size and description . He looked over his books , and came on it at once . He had sent the hat to a Mr. Drebber , residing at Charpentier 's Boarding Establishment , Torquay Terrace . Thus I got at his address . "
20382	20388	20403	20404	the detective	370	" Smart - very smart ! "
20393	20401	20403	20404	the detective	370	" I next called upon Madame Charpentier , "
20406	20512	20280	20280	Gregson	130	" I found her very pale and distressed . Her daughter was in the room , too - an uncommonly fine girl she is , too ; she was looking red about the eyes and her lips trembled as I spoke to her . That did n't escape my notice . I began to smell a rat . You know the feeling , Mr. Sherlock Holmes , when you come upon the right scent - a kind of thrill in your nerves . ' Have you heard of the mysterious death of your late boarder Mr. Enoch J. Drebber , of Cleveland ? ' I asked .
20513	20548	20403	20404	the detective	370	" The mother nodded . She did n't seem able to get out a word . The daughter burst into tears . I felt more than ever that these people knew something of the matter .
20549	20567	20280	20280	Gregson	130	" ' At what o'clock did Mr. Drebber leave your house for the train ? ' I asked .
20568	20617	20403	20404	the detective	370	" ' At eight o'clock , ' she said , gulping in her throat to keep down her agitation . ' His secretary , Mr. Stangerson , said that there were two trains - one at 9.15 and one at 11 . He was to catch the first . '
20618	20631	20280	20280	Gregson	130	" ' And was that the last which you saw of him ? '
20632	20682	20403	20404	the detective	370	" A terrible change came over the woman 's face as I asked the question . Her features turned perfectly livid . It was some seconds before she could get out the single word ' Yes ' - and when it did come it was in a husky unnatural tone .
20683	20701	20280	20280	Gregson	130	" There was silence for a moment , and then the daughter spoke in a calm clear voice .
20702	20736	20403	20404	the detective	370	" ' No good can ever come of falsehood , mother , ' she said . ' Let us be frank with this gentleman . We _ did _ see Mr. Drebber again . '
20737	20766	20280	20280	Gregson	130	" ' God forgive you ! ' cried Madame Charpentier , throwing up her hands and sinking back in her chair . ' You have murdered your brother . '
20767	20783	20403	20404	the detective	370	" ' Arthur would rather that we spoke the truth , ' the girl answered firmly .
20784	20822	20280	20280	Gregson	130	" ' You had best tell me all about it now , ' I said . ' Half - confidences are worse than none . Besides , you do not know how much we know of it . '
20823	20931	20403	20404	the detective	370	" ' On your head be it , Alice ! ' cried her mother ; and then , turning to me , ' I will tell you all , sir . Do not imagine that my agitation on behalf of my son arises from any fear lest he should have had a hand in this terrible affair . He is utterly innocent of it . My dread is , however , that in your eyes and in the eyes of others he may appear to be compromised . That however is surely impossible . His high character , his profession , his antecedents would all forbid it . '
20932	20968	20280	20280	Gregson	130	" ' Your best way is to make a clean breast of the facts , ' I answered . ' Depend upon it , if your son is innocent he will be none the worse . '
20969	21040	20403	20404	the detective	370	" ' Perhaps , Alice , you had better leave us together , ' she said , and her daughter withdrew . ' Now , sir , ' she continued , ' I had no intention of telling you all this , but since my poor daughter has disclosed it I have no alternative . Having once decided to speak , I will tell you all without omitting any particular . '
21041	21051	20280	20280	Gregson	130	" ' It is your wisest course , ' said I.
21052	21082	20403	20404	the detective	370	" ' Mr. Drebber has been with us nearly three weeks . He and his secretary , Mr. Stangerson , had been travelling on the Continent . I noticed a "
21084	21249	20280	20280	Gregson	130	" label upon each of their trunks , showing that that had been their last stopping place . Stangerson was a quiet reserved man , but his employer , I am sorry to say , was far otherwise . He was coarse in his habits and brutish in his ways . The very night of his arrival he became very much the worse for drink , and , indeed , after twelve o'clock in the day he could hardly ever be said to be sober . His manners towards the maid - servants were disgustingly free and familiar . Worst of all , he speedily assumed the same attitude towards my daughter , Alice , and spoke to her more than once in a way which , fortunately , she is too innocent to understand . On one occasion he actually seized her in his arms and embraced her - an outrage which caused his own secretary to reproach him for his unmanly conduct . '
21250	21279	20403	20404	the detective	370	" ' But why did you stand all this , ' I asked . ' I suppose that you can get rid of your boarders when you wish . '
21280	21397	20280	20280	Gregson	130	" Mrs. Charpentier blushed at my pertinent question . ' Would to God that I had given him notice on the very day that he came , ' she said . ' But it was a sore temptation . They were paying a pound a day each - fourteen pounds a week , and this is the slack season . I am a widow , and my boy in the Navy has cost me much . I grudged to lose the money . I acted for the best . This last was too much , however , and I gave him notice to leave on account of it . That was the reason of his going . '
21398	21402	20403	20404	the detective	370	" ' Well ? '
21403	21552	20403	20404	the detective	370	" ' My heart grew light when I saw him drive away . My son is on leave just now , but I did not tell him anything of all this , for his temper is violent , and he is passionately fond of his sister . When I closed the door behind them a load seemed to be lifted from my mind . Alas , in less than an hour there was a ring at the bell , and I learned that Mr. Drebber had returned . He was much excited , and evidently the worse for drink . He forced his way into the room , where I was sitting with my daughter , and made some incoherent remark about having missed his train . He then turned to Alice , and before my very face , proposed to her that she should fly with him . "
21558	21562	21697	21697	I	0	" he said , "
21603	21696	21714	21714	I	0	" Poor Alice was so frightened that she shrunk away from him , but he caught her by the wrist and endeavoured to draw her towards the door . I screamed , and at that moment my son Arthur came into the room . What happened then I do not know . I heard oaths and the confused sounds of a scuffle . I was too terrified to raise my head . When I did look up I saw Arthur standing in the doorway laughing , with a stick in his hand . "
21709	21713	21714	21714	I	0	" he said . "
21728	21755	21837	21838	the detective	370	" With those words he took his hat and started off down the street . The next morning we heard of Mr. Drebber 's mysterious death . '
21756	21808	21817	21818	Sherlock Holmes	110	" This statement came from Mrs. Charpentier 's lips with many gasps and pauses . At times she spoke so low that I could hardly catch the words . I made shorthand notes of all that she said , however , so that there should be no possibility of a mistake . "
21809	21815	21817	21818	Sherlock Holmes	110	" It 's quite exciting , "
21824	21829	21837	21838	the detective	370	" What happened next ? "
21830	21836	21837	21838	the detective	370	" When Mrs. Charpentier paused , "
21841	21878	21837	21838	the detective	370	" I saw that the whole case hung upon one point . Fixing her with my eye in a way which I always found effective with women , I asked her at what hour her son returned .
21879	21889	21837	21838	the detective	370	" ' I do not know , ' she answered .
21890	21895	21837	21838	the detective	370	" ' Not know ? '
21896	21913	21837	21838	the detective	370	" ' No ; he has a latch - key , and he let himself in . '
21914	21922	21837	21838	the detective	370	" ' After you went to bed ? '
21923	21927	21837	21838	the detective	370	" ' Yes . '
21928	21937	21837	21838	the detective	370	" ' When did you go to bed ? '
21938	21943	21837	21838	the detective	370	" ' About eleven . '
21944	21956	21837	21838	the detective	370	" ' So your son was gone at least two hours ? '
21957	21961	21837	21838	the detective	370	" ' Yes . '
21962	21969	21837	21838	the detective	370	" ' Possibly four or five ? '
21970	21974	21837	21838	the detective	370	" ' Yes . '
21975	21985	21837	21838	the detective	370	" ' What was he doing during that time ? '
21986	22003	21837	21838	the detective	370	" ' I do not know , ' she answered , turning white to her very lips .
22004	22102	22108	22108	Holmes	110	" Of course after that there was nothing more to be done . I found out where Lieutenant Charpentier was , took two officers with me , and arrested him . When I touched him on the shoulder and warned him to come quietly with us , he answered us as bold as brass , ' I suppose you are arresting me for being concerned in the death of that scoundrel Drebber , ' he said . We had said nothing to him about it , so that his alluding to it had a most suspicious aspect . "
22103	22106	21837	21838	the detective	370	" Very , "
22110	22138	21837	21838	the detective	370	" He still carried the heavy stick which the mother described him as having with him when he followed Drebber . It was a stout oak cudgel . "
22139	22147	21837	21838	the detective	370	" What is your theory , then ? "
22148	22266	22273	22273	Holmes	110	" Well , my theory is that he followed Drebber as far as the Brixton Road . When there , a fresh altercation arose between them , in the course of which Drebber received a blow from the stick , in the pit of the stomach , perhaps , which killed him without leaving any mark . The night was so wet that no one was about , so Charpentier dragged the body of his victim into the empty house . As to the candle , and the blood , and the writing on the wall , and the ring , they may all be so many tricks to throw the police on to the wrong scent . "
22267	22271	22273	22273	Holmes	110	" Well done ! "
22279	22297	22311	22312	the detective	370	" Really , Gregson , you are getting along . We shall make something of you yet . "
22298	22310	22311	22312	the detective	370	" I flatter myself that I have managed it rather neatly , "
22316	22439	22550	22550	he	119	" The young man volunteered a statement , in which he said that after following Drebber some time , the latter perceived him , and took a cab in order to get away from him . On his way home he met an old shipmate , and took a long walk with him . On being asked where this old shipmate lived , he was unable to give any satisfactory reply . I think the whole case fits together uncommonly well . What amuses me is to think of Lestrade , who had started off upon the wrong scent . I am afraid he wo n't make much of it . Why , by Jove , here 's the very man himself ! "
22541	22549	22550	22550	he	119	" This is a most extraordinary case , "
22555	22561	22575	22575	Gregson	130	" a most incomprehensible affair . "
22562	22573	22575	22575	Gregson	130	" Ah , you find it so , Mr. Lestrade ! "
22579	22601	22612	22612	Lestrade	119	" I thought you would come to that conclusion . Have you managed to find the Secretary , Mr. Joseph Stangerson ? "
22602	22610	22612	22612	Lestrade	119	" The Secretary , Mr. Joseph Stangerson , "
22615	22629	22694	22694	he	130	" was murdered at Halliday 's Private Hotel about six o'clock this morning . "
22689	22693	22694	22694	he	130	" Stangerson too ! "
22697	22702	22713	22713	Lestrade	119	" The plot thickens . "
22703	22711	22713	22713	Lestrade	119	" It was quite thick enough before , "
22719	22733	22749	22749	Gregson	130	" I seem to have dropped into a sort of council of war . "
22734	22747	22762	22762	Lestrade	119	" Are you - are you sure of this piece of intelligence ? "
22751	22760	22762	22762	Lestrade	119	" I have just come from his room , "
22764	22775	22789	22789	Holmes	110	" I was the first to discover what had occurred . "
22776	22788	22789	22789	Holmes	110	" We have been hearing Gregson 's view of the matter , "
22792	22806	22814	22814	Lestrade	119	" Would you mind letting us know what you have seen and done ? "
22807	22813	22814	22814	Lestrade	119	" I have no objection , "
22820	23025	23042	23042	Holmes	110	" I freely confess that I was of the opinion that Stangerson was concerned in the death of Drebber . This fresh development has shown me that I was completely mistaken . Full of the one idea , I set myself to find out what had become of the Secretary . They had been seen together at Euston Station about half - past eight on the evening of the third . At two in the morning Drebber had been found in the Brixton Road . The question which confronted me was to find out how Stangerson had been employed between 8.30 and the time of the crime , and what had become of him afterwards . I telegraphed to Liverpool , giving a description of the man , and warning them to keep a watch upon the American boats . I then set to work calling upon all the hotels and lodging - houses in the vicinity of Euston . You see , I argued that if Drebber and his companion had become separated , the natural course for the latter would be to put up somewhere in the vicinity for the night , and then to hang about the station again next morning . "
23026	23040	22814	22814	Lestrade	119	" They would be likely to agree on some meeting - place beforehand , "
23044	23107	22814	22814	Lestrade	119	" So it proved . I spent the whole of yesterday evening in making enquiries entirely without avail . This morning I began very early , and at eight o'clock I reached Halliday 's Private Hotel , in Little George Street . On my enquiry as to whether a Mr. Stangerson was living there , they at once answered me in the affirmative .
23108	23137	22814	22814	Lestrade	119	" ' No doubt you are the gentleman whom he was expecting , ' they said . ' He has been waiting for a gentleman for two days . '
23138	23148	22814	22814	Lestrade	119	" ' Where is he now ? ' I asked .
23149	23165	22814	22814	Lestrade	119	" ' He is upstairs in bed . He wished to be called at nine . '
23166	23181	22814	22814	Lestrade	119	" ' I will go up and see him at once , ' I said .
23182	23453	23487	23487	he	110	" It seemed to me that my sudden appearance might shake his nerves and lead him to say something unguarded . The Boots volunteered to show me the room : it was on the second floor , and there was a small corridor leading up to it . The Boots pointed out the door to me , and was about to go downstairs again when I saw something that made me feel sickish , in spite of my twenty years ' experience . From under the door there curled a little red ribbon of blood , which had meandered across the passage and formed a little pool along the skirting at the other side . I gave a cry , which brought the Boots back . He nearly fainted when he saw it . The door was locked on the inside , but we put our shoulders to it , and knocked it in . The window of the room was open , and beside the window , all huddled up , lay the body of a man in his nightdress . He was quite dead , and had been for some time , for his limbs were rigid and cold . When we turned him over , the Boots recognized him at once as being the same gentleman who had engaged the room under the name of Joseph Stangerson . The cause of death was a deep stab in the left side , which must have penetrated the heart . And now comes the strangest part of the affair . What do you suppose was above the murdered man ? "
23475	23486	23497	23497	Lestrade	119	" The word RACHE , written in letters of blood , "
23490	23495	23568	23568	Lestrade	119	" That was it , "
23560	23566	23568	23568	Lestrade	119	" The man was seen , "
23570	23762	23816	23816	he	110	" A milk boy , passing on his way to the dairy , happened to walk down the lane which leads from the mews at the back of the hotel . He noticed that a ladder , which usually lay there , was raised against one of the windows of the second floor , which was wide open . After passing , he looked back and saw a man descend the ladder . He came down so quietly and openly that the boy imagined him to be some carpenter or joiner at work in the hotel . He took no particular notice of him , beyond thinking in his own mind that it was early for him to be at work . He has an impression that the man was tall , had a reddish face , and was dressed in a long , brownish coat . He must have stayed in the room some little time after the murder , for we found blood - stained water in the basin , where he had washed his hands , and marks on the sheets where he had deliberately wiped his knife . "
23798	23815	23763	23763	I	0	" Did you find nothing in the room which could furnish a clue to the murderer ? "
23819	23924	23933	23933	Holmes	110	" Nothing . Stangerson had Drebber 's purse in his pocket , but it seems that this was usual , as he did all the paying . There was eighty odd pounds in it , but nothing had been taken . Whatever the motives of these extraordinary crimes , robbery is certainly not one of them . There were no papers or memoranda in the murdered man 's pocket , except a single telegram , dated from Cleveland about a month ago , and containing the words , ' J. H. is in Europe . ' There was no name appended to this message . "
23925	23932	23763	23763	I	0	" And there was nothing else ? "
23936	23998	24017	24017	he	110	" Nothing of any importance . The man 's novel , with which he had read himself to sleep was lying upon the bed , and his pipe was on a chair beside him . There was a glass of water on the table , and on the window - sill a small chip ointment box containing a couple of pills . "
24011	24016	24017	24017	he	110	" The last link , "
24022	24028	24047	24048	my companion	243	" My case is complete . "
24038	24046	24047	24048	my companion	243	" I have now in my hands , "
24053	24140	24148	24148	Lestrade	119	" all the threads which have formed such a tangle . There are , of course , details to be filled in , but I am as certain of all the main facts , from the time that Drebber parted from Stangerson at the station , up to the discovery of the body of the latter , as if I had seen them with my own eyes . I will give you a proof of my knowledge . Could you lay your hand upon those pills ? "
24141	24146	24148	24148	Lestrade	119	" I have them , "
24156	24208	24216	24216	Holmes	110	" I took them and the purse and the telegram , intending to have them put in a place of safety at the Police Station . It was the merest chance my taking these pills , for I am bound to say that I do not attach any importance to them . "
24209	24214	24216	24216	Holmes	110	" Give them here , "
24218	24223	24216	24216	Holmes	110	" Now , Doctor , "
24228	24234	24277	24277	I	0	" are those ordinary pills ? "
24259	24276	24286	24286	Holmes	110	" From their lightness and transparency , I should imagine that they are soluble in water , "
24280	24284	24286	24286	Holmes	110	" Precisely so , "
24288	24325	24398	24398	Holmes	110	" Now would you mind going down and fetching that poor little devil of a terrier which has been bad so long , and which the landlady wanted you to put out of its pain yesterday . "
24384	24396	24404	24404	he	110	" I will now cut one of these pills in two , "
24412	24461	24471	24471	Lestrade	119	" One half we return into the box for future purposes . The other half I will place in this wine glass , in which is a teaspoonful of water . You perceive that our friend , the Doctor , is right , and that it readily dissolves . "
24462	24469	24471	24471	Lestrade	119	" This may be very interesting , "
24488	24509	24566	24566	he	110	" I can not see , however , what it has to do with the death of Mr. Joseph Stangerson . "
24510	24562	24745	24745	he	110	" Patience , my friend , patience ! You will find in time that it has everything to do with it . I shall now add a little milk to make the mixture palatable , and on presenting it to the dog we find that he laps it up readily enough . "
24736	24744	24745	24745	he	110	" It ca n't be a coincidence , "
24763	24842	24936	24936	he	110	" it is impossible that it should be a mere coincidence . The very pills which I suspected in the case of Drebber are actually found after the death of Stangerson . And yet they are inert . What can it mean ? Surely my whole chain of reasoning can not have been false . It is impossible ! And yet this wretched dog is none the worse . Ah , I have it ! I have it ! "
24928	24935	24936	24936	he	110	" I should have more faith , "
24939	25011	25093	25093	Holmes	110	" I ought to know by this time that when a fact appears to be opposed to a long train of deductions , it invariably proves to be capable of bearing some other interpretation . Of the two pills in that box one was of the most deadly poison , and the other was entirely harmless . I ought to have known that before ever I saw the box at all . "
25083	25091	25093	25093	Holmes	110	" All this seems strange to you , "
25095	25276	25305	25305	he	110	" because you failed at the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the single real clue which was presented to you . I had the good fortune to seize upon that , and everything which has occurred since then has served to confirm my original supposition , and , indeed , was the logical sequence of it . Hence things which have perplexed you and made the case more obscure , have served to enlighten me and to strengthen my conclusions . It is a mistake to confound strangeness with mystery . The most commonplace crime is often the most mysterious because it presents no new or special features from which deductions may be drawn . This murder would have been infinitely more difficult to unravel had the body of the victim been simply found lying in the roadway without any of those _ outré _ and sensational accompaniments which have rendered it remarkable . These strange details , far from making the case more difficult , have really had the effect of making it less so . "
25296	25304	25305	25305	he	110	" Look here , Mr. Sherlock Holmes , "
25308	25452	25468	25468	Lestrade	119	" we are all ready to acknowledge that you are a smart man , and that you have your own methods of working . We want something more than mere theory and preaching now , though . It is a case of taking the man . I have made my case out , and it seems I was wrong . Young Charpentier could not have been engaged in this second affair . Lestrade went after his man , Stangerson , and it appears that he was wrong too . You have thrown out hints here , and hints there , and seem to know more than we do , but the time has come when we feel that we have a right to ask you straight how much you do know of the business . Can you name the man who did it ? "
25453	25466	25468	25468	Lestrade	119	" I can not help feeling that Gregson is right , sir , "
25470	25514	25524	25524	I	0	" We have both tried , and we have both failed . You have remarked more than once since I have been in the room that you had all the evidence which you require . Surely you will not withhold it any longer . "
25515	25523	25524	25524	I	0	" Any delay in arresting the assassin , "
25527	25538	25591	25591	he	110	" might give him time to perpetrate some fresh atrocity . "
25582	25590	25591	25591	he	110	" There will be no more murders , "
25602	25860	25952	25952	he	572	" You can put that consideration out of the question . You have asked me if I know the name of the assassin . I do . The mere knowing of his name is a small thing , however , compared with the power of laying our hands upon him . This I expect very shortly to do . I have good hopes of managing it through my own arrangements ; but it is a thing which needs delicate handling , for we have a shrewd and desperate man to deal with , who is supported , as I have had occasion to prove , by another who is as clever as himself . As long as this man has no idea that anyone can have a clue there is some chance of securing him ; but if he had the slightest suspicion , he would change his name , and vanish in an instant among the four million inhabitants of this great city . Without meaning to hurt either of your feelings , I am bound to say that I consider these men to be more than a match for the official force , and that is why I have not asked your assistance . If I fail I shall , of course , incur all the blame due to this omission ; but that I am prepared for . At present I am ready to promise that the instant that I can communicate with you without endangering my own combinations , I shall do so . "
25946	25951	25952	25952	he	572	" Please , sir , "
25959	25966	25973	25973	Holmes	110	" I have the cab downstairs . "
25967	25971	25990	25990	he	572	" Good boy , "
25977	25989	25990	25990	he	572	" Why do n't you introduce this pattern at Scotland Yard ? "
26003	26017	26028	26028	Lestrade	119	" See how beautifully the spring works . They fasten in an instant . "
26018	26026	26028	26028	Lestrade	119	" The old pattern is good enough , "
26030	26043	26053	26053	Holmes	110	" if we can only find the man to put them on . "
26044	26051	26053	26053	Holmes	110	" Very good , very good , "
26057	26078	26155	26155	he	243	" The cabman may as well help me with my boxes . Just ask him to step up , Wiggins . "
26142	26154	26216	26216	he	110	" Just give me a help with this buckle , cabman , "
26212	26215	26216	26216	he	110	" Gentlemen , "
26223	26243	26527	26528	Sherlock Holmes	110	" let me introduce you to Mr. Jefferson Hope , the murderer of Enoch Drebber and of Joseph Stangerson . "
26519	26525	26547	26547	he	110	" We have his cab , "
26530	26546	26547	26547	he	110	" It will serve to take him to Scotland Yard . And now , gentlemen , "
26555	26594	27494	27494	he	1387	" we have reached the end of our little mystery . You are very welcome to put any questions that you like to me now , and there is no danger that I will refuse to answer them . "
27476	27493	27575	27577	the grey parcel	632	" Why not here , as well as in a feather bed , twenty years hence , "
27608	27614	27627	27628	the man	1387	" You 've hurt me ! "
27621	27626	27627	27628	the man	1387	" Have I though , "
27632	27642	27718	27718	she	637	" I did n't go for to do it . "
27706	27712	27743	27743	she	637	" How is it now ? "
27734	27742	27743	27743	she	637	" Kiss it and make it well , "
27758	27771	27718	27718	she	637	" That 's what mother used to do . Where 's mother ? "
27772	27786	27794	27796	the little girl	639	" Mother 's gone . I guess you 'll see her before long . "
27787	27792	27794	27796	the little girl	639	" Gone , eh ! "
27798	27857	27718	27718	she	637	" Funny , she did n't say good - bye ; she ' most always did if she was just goin' over to Auntie 's for tea , and now she 's been away three days . Say , it 's awful dry , ai n't it ? Ai n't there no water , nor nothing to eat ? "
27858	27935	27945	27947	the little girl	639	" No , there ai n't nothing , dearie . You 'll just need to be patient awhile , and then you 'll be all right . Put your head up agin me like that , and then you 'll feel bullier . It ai n't easy to talk when your lips is like leather , but I guess I 'd best let you know how the cards lie . What 's that you 've got ? "
27936	27943	27945	27947	the little girl	639	" Pretty things ! fine things ! "
27958	27973	27986	27987	the man	1387	" When we goes back to home I 'll give them to brother Bob . "
27974	27984	27986	27987	the man	1387	" You 'll see prettier things than them soon , "
27990	28013	27718	27718	she	637	" You just wait a bit . I was going to tell you though - you remember when we left the river ? "
28014	28019	27986	27987	the man	1387	" Oh , yes . "
28020	28075	28093	28093	his	1387	" Well , we reckoned we 'd strike another river soon , d'ye see . But there was somethin' wrong ; compasses , or map , or somethin' , and it did n't turn up . Water ran out . Just except a little drop for the likes of you and - and - - "
28076	28084	27986	27987	the man	1387	" And you could n't wash yourself , "
28097	28137	28148	28150	the little girl	639	" No , nor drink . And Mr. Bender , he was the fust to go , and then Indian Pete , and then Mrs. McGregor , and then Johnny Hones , and then , dearie , your mother . "
28138	28146	27986	27987	the man	1387	" Then mother 's a deader too , "
28161	28219	28234	28235	the child	637	" Yes , they all went except you and me . Then I thought there was some chance of water in this direction , so I heaved you over my shoulder and we tramped it together . It do n't seem as though we 've improved matters . There 's an almighty small chance for us now ! "
28220	28232	27986	27987	the man	1387	" Do you mean that we are going to die too ? "
28249	28260	28271	28271	she	639	" I guess that 's about the size of it . "
28261	28270	28271	28271	she	639	" Why did n't you say so before ? "
28277	28303	27986	27987	the man	1387	" You gave me such a fright . Why , of course , now as long as we die we 'll be with mother again . "
28304	28312	28271	28271	she	639	" Yes , you will , dearie . "
28313	28377	28389	28390	The man	1387	" And you too . I 'll tell her how awful good you 've been . I 'll bet she meets us at the door of Heaven with a big pitcher of water , and a lot of buckwheat cakes , hot , and toasted on both sides , like Bob and me was fond of . How long will it be first ? "
28378	28388	28481	28483	the little girl	639	" I do n't know - not very long . "
28474	28479	28496	28496	her	639	" Cocks and hens , "
28503	28512	28521	28522	her companion	638	" Say , did God make this country ? "
28513	28519	28547	28549	the little girl	639	" In course He did , "
28531	28546	28547	28549	the little girl	639	" He made the country down in Illinois , and He made the Missouri , "
28552	28580	28592	28593	the man	1387	" I guess somebody else made the country in these parts . It 's not nearly so well done . They forgot the water and the trees . "
28581	28591	28605	28605	she	639	" What would ye think of offering up prayer ? "
28597	28604	28547	28549	the little girl	639	" It ai n't night yet , "
28608	28652	28663	28664	the child	637	" It do n't matter . It ai n't quite regular , but He wo n't mind that , you bet . You say over them ones that you used to say every night in the waggon when we was on the Plains . "
28653	28662	28677	28677	he	1387	" Why do n't you say some yourself ? "
28671	28676	28677	28677	he	1387	" I disremember them , "
28680	28721	28736	28736	she	639	" I hain't said none since I was half the height o ' that gun . I guess it 's never too late . You say them out , and I 'll stand by and come in on the choruses . "
28722	28735	28736	28736	she	639	" Then you 'll need to kneel down , and me too , "
28747	28768	29379	29390	a hard - lipped , clean - shaven man with grizzly hair	693	" You 've got to put your hands up like this . It makes you feel kind o ' good . "
29364	29375	29411	29411	another	1549	" The wells are to the right , my brothers , "
29392	29409	29421	29422	a third	695	" To the right of the Sierra Blanco - so we shall reach the Rio Grande , "
29413	29419	29421	29422	a third	695	" Fear not for water , "
29424	29442	29450	29452	the whole party	696	" He who could draw it from the rocks will not now abandon His own chosen people . "
29443	29448	29555	29563	the elderly man who appeared to be in command	702	" Amen ! Amen ! "
29542	29553	29555	29563	the elderly man who appeared to be in command	702	" There ca n't be any number of Injuns here , "
29565	29585	29599	29602	one of the band	703	" We have passed the Pawnees , and there are no other tribes until we cross the great mountains . "
29586	29597	29555	29563	the elderly man who appeared to be in command	702	" Shall I go forward and see , Brother Stangerson , "
29604	29608	29615	29617	a dozen voices	705	" And I , "
29609	29613	29632	29633	the Elder	706	" and I , "
29619	29631	30016	30016	he	1387	" Leave your horses below and we will await you here , "
30004	30015	30106	30107	the wanderer	666	" This is what they call delirium , I guess , "
30098	30105	30106	30107	the wanderer	666	" My name is John Ferrier , "
30110	30144	30153	30153	someone	1321	" me and that little un are all that 's left o ' twenty - one people . The rest is all dead o ' thirst and hunger away down in the south . "
30145	30151	30163	30164	the other	569	" Is she your child ? "
30155	30162	30202	30202	he	736	" I guess she is now , "
30169	30201	30202	30202	he	736	" she 's mine 'cause I saved her . No man will take her from me . She 's Lucy Ferrier from this day on . Who are you , though ? "
30215	30226	30235	30239	one of the young men	738	" there seems to be a powerful lot of ye . "
30227	30233	30235	30239	one of the young men	738	" Nigh upon ten thousand , "
30241	30257	30268	30269	the wanderer	666	" we are the persecuted children of God - the chosen of the Angel Merona . "
30258	30266	30268	30269	the wanderer	666	" I never heard tell on him , "
30271	30283	30296	30297	the other	569	" He appears to have chosen a fair crowd of ye . "
30284	30294	30296	30297	the other	569	" Do not jest at that which is sacred , "
30300	30378	30395	30395	he	175	" We are of those who believe in those sacred writings , drawn in Egyptian letters on plates of beaten gold , which were handed unto the holy Joseph Smith at Palmyra . We have come from Nauvoo , in the State of Illinois , where we had founded our temple . We have come to seek a refuge from the violent man and from the godless , even though it be the heart of the desert . "
30390	30394	30395	30395	he	175	" I see , "
30398	30404	30413	30414	his companions	742	" you are the Mormons . "
30405	30411	30395	30395	he	175	" We are the Mormons , "
30419	30426	30395	30395	he	175	" And where are you going ? "
30427	30464	30681	30681	he	757	" We do not know . The hand of God is leading us under the person of our Prophet . You must come before him . He shall say what is to be done with you . "
30672	30680	30681	30681	he	757	" If we take you with us , "
30688	30748	30762	30762	Ferrier	175	" it can only be as believers in our own creed . We shall have no wolves in our fold . Better far that your bones should bleach in this wilderness than that you should prove to be that little speck of decay which in time corrupts the whole fruit . Will you come with us on these terms ? "
30749	30760	30795	30795	he	757	" Guess I 'll come with you on any terms , "
30787	30794	30795	30795	he	757	" Take him , Brother Stangerson , "
30798	30837	30847	30850	the crowd of Mormons	763	" give him food and drink , and the child likewise . Let it be your task also to teach him our holy creed . We have delayed long enough . Forward ! On , on to Zion ! "
30838	30845	30940	30940	he	768	" On , on to Zion ! "
30933	30939	30940	30940	he	768	" You shall remain here , "
30943	30996	32774	32775	her preserver	879	" In a few days you will have recovered from your fatigues . In the meantime , remember that now and for ever you are of our religion . Brigham Young has said it , and he has spoken with the voice of Joseph Smith , which is the voice of God . "
32761	32772	32800	32800	she	854	" You 're not hurt , I hope , miss , "
32793	32799	32800	32800	she	854	" I 'm awful frightened , "
32805	32823	32833	32834	the other	569	" whoever would have thought that Poncho would have been so scared by a lot of cows ? "
32824	32832	32887	32887	he	879	" Thank God you kept your seat , "
32875	32886	32887	32887	he	879	" I guess you are the daughter of John Ferrier , "
32890	32932	32944	32944	she	883	" I saw you ride down from his house . When you see him , ask him if he remembers the Jefferson Hopes of St. Louis . If he 's the same Ferrier , my father and he were pretty thick . "
32933	32943	32973	32973	he	884	" Had n't you better come and ask yourself ? "
32966	32972	32973	32973	he	884	" I 'll do so , "
32976	33006	33024	33024	she	883	" we 've been in the mountains for two months , and are not over and above in visiting condition . He must take us as he finds us . "
33007	33023	33024	33024	she	883	" He has a good deal to thank you for , and so have I , "
33027	33050	33058	33059	her companion	638	" he 's awful fond of me . If those cows had jumped on me he 'd have never got over it . "
33051	33056	33024	33024	she	883	" Neither would I , "
33061	33090	33119	33119	she	883	" You ! Well , I do n't see that it would make much matter to you , anyhow . You ai n't even a friend of ours . "
33109	33118	33119	33119	she	883	" There , I did n't mean that , "
33122	33161	33168	33168	he	886	" of course , you are a friend now . You must come and see us . Now I must push along , or father wo n't trust me with his business any more . Good - bye ! "
33162	33167	33707	33707	he	886	" Good - bye , "
33699	33706	33707	33707	he	886	" I am off , Lucy , "
33725	33750	33759	33759	she	896	" I wo n't ask you to come with me now , but will you be ready to come when I am here again ? "
33751	33758	33707	33707	he	886	" And when will that be ? "
33766	33796	33804	33804	she	896	" A couple of months at the outside . I will come and claim you then , my darling . There 's no one who can stand between us . "
33797	33803	33707	33707	he	886	" And how about father ? "
33807	33831	33858	33858	she	896	" He has given his consent , provided we get these mines working all right . I have no fear on that head . "
33832	33857	33874	33874	he	909	" Oh , well ; of course , if you and father have arranged it all , there 's no more to be said , "
33869	33873	33874	33874	he	909	" Thank God ! "
33884	33933	34868	34868	he	175	" It is settled , then . The longer I stay , the harder it will be to go . They are waiting for me at the cañon . Good - bye , my own darling - good - bye . In two months you shall see me . "
34863	34867	34868	34868	he	175	" Brother Ferrier , "
34888	34949	34957	34958	John Ferrier	175	" the true believers have been good friends to you . We picked you up when you were starving in the desert , we shared our food with you , led you safe to the Chosen Valley , gave you a goodly share of land , and allowed you to wax rich under our protection . Is not this so ? "
34950	34955	34868	34868	he	175	" It is so , "
34960	35011	35022	35022	Ferrier	175	" In return for all this we asked but one condition : that was , that you should embrace the true faith , and conform in every way to its usages . This you promised to do , and this , if common report says truly , you have neglected . "
35012	35020	35026	35026	his	175	" And how have I neglected it ? "
35031	35055	35064	35064	Young	187	" Have I not given to the common fund ? Have I not attended at the Temple ? Have I not - - ? "
35056	35062	35064	35064	Young	187	" Where are your wives ? "
35070	35081	35093	35093	Ferrier	175	" Call them in , that I may greet them . "
35082	35092	35093	35093	Ferrier	175	" It is true that I have not married , "
35096	35129	35145	35149	the leader of the Mormons	974	" But women were few , and there were many who had better claims than I. I was not a lonely man : I had my daughter to attend to my wants . "
35130	35143	35145	35149	the leader of the Mormons	974	" It is of that daughter that I would speak to you , "
35151	35178	35179	35180	John Ferrier	175	" She has grown to be the flower of Utah , and has found favour in the eyes of many who are high in the land . "
35184	35281	35289	35289	he	175	" There are stories of her which I would fain disbelieve - stories that she is sealed to some Gentile . This must be the gossip of idle tongues . What is the thirteenth rule in the code of the sainted Joseph Smith ? ' Let every maiden of the true faith marry one of the elect ; for if she we d a Gentile , she commits a grievous sin . ' This being so , it is impossible that you , who profess the holy creed , should suffer your daughter to violate it . "
35298	35409	35453	35453	he	175	" Upon this one point your whole faith shall be tested - so it has been decided in the Sacred Council of Four . The girl is young , and we would not have her we d grey hairs , neither would we deprive her of all choice . We Elders have many heifers,[1 ] but our children must also be provided . Stangerson has a son , and Drebber has a son , and either of them would gladly welcome your daughter to their house . Let her choose between them . They are young and rich , and of the true faith . What say you to that ? "
35445	35452	35453	35453	he	175	" You will give us time , "
35458	35474	35486	35486	Young	187	" My daughter is very young - she is scarce of an age to marry . "
35475	35484	35486	35486	Young	187	" She shall have a month to choose , "
35493	35506	35536	35536	he	175	" At the end of that time she shall give her answer . "
35525	35535	35536	35536	he	175	" It were better for you , John Ferrier , "
35539	35570	35664	35664	she	800	" that you and she were now lying blanched skeletons upon the Sierra Blanco , than that you should put your weak wills against the orders of the Holy Four ! "
35656	35663	35664	35664	she	800	" I could not help it , "
35673	35692	35701	35701	he	175	" His voice rang through the house . Oh , father , father , what shall we do ? "
35693	35700	35711	35711	his	175	" Do n't you scare yourself , "
35722	35749	35711	35711	his	175	" We 'll fix it up somehow or another . You do n't find your fancy kind o ' lessening for this chap , do you ? "
35763	35865	35866	35866	Lucy	176	" No ; of course not . I should n't care to hear you say you did . He 's a likely lad , and he 's a Christian , which is more than these folk here , in spite o ' all their praying and preaching . There 's a party starting for Nevada to - morrow , and I 'll manage to send him a message letting him know the hole we are in . If I know anything o ' that young man , he 'll be back here with a speed that would whip electro - telegraphs . "
35877	35924	35935	35936	her father	843	" When he comes , he will advise us for the best . But it is for you that I am frightened , dear . One hears - one hears such dreadful stories about those who oppose the Prophet : something terrible always happens to them . "
35925	35934	35935	35936	her father	843	" But we have n't opposed him yet , "
35939	35977	35866	35866	Lucy	176	" It will be time to look out for squalls when we do . We have a clear month before us ; at the end of that , I guess we had best shin out of Utah . "
35978	35982	35935	35936	her father	843	" Leave Utah ! "
35983	35992	35866	35866	Lucy	176	" That 's about the size of it . "
35993	35998	35935	35936	her father	843	" But the farm ? "
35999	36106	35866	35866	Lucy	176	" We will raise as much as we can in money , and let the rest go . To tell the truth , Lucy , it is n't the first time I have thought of doing it . I do n't care about knuckling under to any man , as these folk do to their darned prophet . I 'm a free - born American , and it 's all new to me . Guess I 'm too old to learn . If he comes browsing about this farm , he might chance to run up against a charge of buckshot travelling in the opposite direction . "
36107	36116	35935	35936	her father	843	" But they wo n't let us leave , "
36121	36184	36457	36457	he	175	" Wait till Jefferson comes , and we 'll soon manage that . In the meantime , do n't you fret yourself , my dearie , and do n't get your eyes swelled up , else he 'll be walking into me when he sees you . There 's nothing to be afeared about , and there 's no danger at all . "
36448	36456	36457	36457	he	175	" Maybe you do n't know us , "
36460	36498	36514	36515	the other	569	" This here is the son of Elder Drebber , and I 'm Joseph Stangerson , who travelled with you in the desert when the Lord stretched out His hand and gathered you into the true fold . "
36499	36512	36514	36515	the other	569	" As He will all the nations in His own good time , "
36521	36529	36550	36550	Stangerson	128	" He grindeth slowly but exceeding small . "
36543	36548	36550	36550	Stangerson	128	" We have come , "
36552	36604	36615	36616	the other	569	" at the advice of our fathers to solicit the hand of your daughter for whichever of us may seem good to you and to her . As I have but four wives and Brother Drebber here has seven , it appears to me that my claim is the stronger one . "
36605	36613	36615	36616	the other	569	" Nay , nay , Brother Stangerson , "
36618	36654	36664	36665	the other	569	" the question is not how many wives we have , but how many we can keep . My father has now given over his mills to me , and I am the richer man . "
36655	36662	36664	36665	the other	569	" But my prospects are better , "
36669	36701	36714	36715	young Drebber	123	" When the Lord removes my father , I shall have his tanning yard and his leather factory . Then I am your elder , and am higher in the Church . "
36702	36712	36719	36719	his	123	" It will be for the maiden to decide , "
36726	36736	36771	36771	he	175	" We will leave it all to her decision . "
36766	36770	36771	36771	he	175	" Look here , "
36781	36805	36852	36852	Ferrier	175	" when my daughter summons you , you can come , but until then I do n't want to see your faces again . "
36840	36850	36852	36852	Ferrier	175	" There are two ways out of the room , "
36854	36873	36925	36925	he	904	" there is the door , and there is the window . Which do you care to use ? "
36910	36924	36938	36938	Stangerson	174	" Let me know when you have settled which it is to be , "
36930	36937	36938	36938	Stangerson	174	" You shall smart for this ! "
36945	36968	36983	36984	young Drebber	123	" You have defied the Prophet and the Council of Four . You shall rue it to the end of your days . "
36969	36981	36983	36984	young Drebber	123	" The hand of the Lord shall be heavy upon you , "
36986	36994	37005	37005	Ferrier	175	" He will arise and smite you ! "
36995	37003	37057	37057	he	175	" Then I 'll start the smiting , "
37050	37056	37057	37057	he	175	" The young canting rascals ! "
37067	37088	37098	37098	she	1006	" I would sooner see you in your grave , my girl , than the wife of either of them . "
37089	37097	37098	37098	she	1006	" And so should I , father , "
37104	37112	37057	37057	he	175	" but Jefferson will soon be here . "
37113	37142	37464	37464	He	175	" Yes . It will not be long before he comes . The sooner the better , for we do not know what their next move may be . "
37404	37419	38439	38440	John Ferrier	175	" Twenty - nine days are given you for amendment , and then - - "
38433	38437	38439	38440	John Ferrier	175	" Good God ! "
38442	38456	38463	38464	the other	569	" How you scared me ! Whatever made you come in like that . "
38457	38462	38463	38464	the other	569	" Give me food , "
38469	38487	38523	38523	he	175	" I have had no time for bite or sup for eight - and - forty hours . "
38515	38522	38544	38545	her father	843	" Does Lucy bear up well ? "
38533	38543	38609	38609	He	175	" Yes . She does not know the danger , "
38548	38591	38633	38633	he	175	" That is well . The house is watched on every side . That is why I crawled my way up to it . They may be darned sharp , but they 're not quite sharp enough to catch a Washoe hunter . "
38622	38632	38633	38633	he	175	" You 're a man to be proud of , "
38636	38652	38663	38665	the young hunter	886	" There are not many who would come to share our danger and our troubles . "
38653	38662	38663	38665	the young hunter	886	" You 've hit it there , pard , "
38668	38729	38633	38633	he	175	" I have a respect for you , but if you were alone in this business I 'd think twice before I put my head into such a hornet 's nest . It 's Lucy that brings me here , and before harm comes on her I guess there will be one less o ' the Hope family in Utah . "
38730	38737	38663	38665	the young hunter	886	" What are we to do ? "
38738	38777	38633	38633	he	175	" To - morrow is your last day , and unless you act to - night you are lost . I have a mule and two horses waiting in the Eagle Ravine . How much money have you ? "
38778	38790	38663	38665	the young hunter	886	" Two thousand dollars in gold , and five in notes . "
38791	38836	38944	38945	Jefferson Hope	187	" That will do . I have as much more to add to it . We must push for Carson City through the mountains . You had best wake Lucy . It is as well that the servants do not sleep in the house . "
38933	38942	38944	38945	Jefferson Hope	187	" We must make our start at once , "
38974	39029	39039	39039	Ferrier	176	" The front and back entrances are watched , but with caution we may get away through the side window and across the fields . Once on the road we are only two miles from the Ravine where the horses are waiting . By daybreak we should be half - way through the mountains . "
39030	39037	39075	39075	he	187	" What if we are stopped , "
39055	39074	39445	39452	the first who appeared to be in authority	1090	" If they are too many for us we shall take two or three of them with us , "
39436	39443	39445	39452	the first who appeared to be in authority	1090	" To - morrow at midnight , "
39454	39466	39474	39475	the other	569	" When the Whip - poor - Will calls three times . "
39467	39472	39474	39475	the other	569	" It is well , "
39477	39484	39445	39452	the first who appeared to be in authority	1090	" Shall I tell Brother Drebber ? "
39485	39503	39511	39512	the other	569	" Pass it on to him , and from him to the others . Nine to seven ! "
39504	39509	39600	39600	he	187	" Seven to five ! "
39592	39599	39600	39600	he	187	" Hurry on ! hurry on ! "
39607	39624	40009	40009	his	187	" We are through the line of sentinels . Everything depends on speed . Hurry on ! "
40013	40018	40032	40033	Jefferson Hope	187	" Who goes there ? "
40025	40030	40075	40075	he	187	" Travellers for Nevada , "
40069	40074	40085	40085	Ferrier	176	" By whose permission ? "
40078	40083	40112	40113	the sentinel	1121	" The Holy Four , "
40105	40110	40122	40123	Jefferson Hope	187	" Nine from seven , "
40115	40120	40155	40155	his	1120	" Seven from five , "
40137	40147	40498	40498	he	187	" Pass , and the Lord go with you , "
40486	40497	40498	40498	he	187	" They will be upon our track by this time , "
40501	40522	42408	42408	he	187	" Everything depends upon our speed . Once safe in Carson we may rest for the remainder of our lives . "
42401	42407	42408	42408	he	187	" I am Jefferson Hope , "
42411	42416	42489	42489	he	1194	" You remember me . "
42480	42488	42489	42489	he	1194	" You are mad to come here , "
42492	42526	42539	42539	Hope	187	" It is as much as my own life is worth to be seen talking with you . There is a warrant against you from the Holy Four for assisting the Ferriers away . "
42527	42538	42539	42539	Hope	187	" I do n't fear them , or their warrant , "
42544	42587	42594	42595	the Mormon	1194	" You must know something of this matter , Cowper . I conjure you by everything you hold dear to answer a few questions . We have always been friends . For God 's sake , do n't refuse to answer me . "
42588	42593	42594	42595	the Mormon	1194	" What is it ? "
42599	42613	42489	42489	he	1194	" Be quick . The very rocks have ears and the trees eyes . "
42614	42622	42594	42595	the Mormon	1194	" What has become of Lucy Ferrier ? "
42623	42648	42657	42657	Hope	187	" She was married yesterday to young Drebber . Hold up , man , hold up , you have no life left in you . "
42649	42655	42660	42660	He	187	" Do n't mind me , "
42682	42688	42594	42595	the Mormon	1194	" Married , you say ? "
42689	42810	42820	42821	Jefferson Hope	187	" Married yesterday - that 's what those flags are for on the Endowment House . There was some words between young Drebber and young Stangerson as to which was to have her . They 'd both been in the party that followed them , and Stangerson had shot her father , which seemed to give him the best claim ; but when they argued it out in council , Drebber 's party was the stronger , so the Prophet gave her over to him . No one wo n't have her very long though , for I saw death in her face yesterday . She is more like a ghost than a woman . Are you off , then ? "
42811	42818	42594	42595	the Mormon	1194	" Yes , I am off , "
42857	42863	42869	42869	he	187	" Where are you going ? "
42864	42868	43141	43141	he	1210	" Never mind , "
43131	43140	44335	44335	he	1266	" She shall not be buried in that , "
44319	44334	44335	44335	he	1266	" I guess you 're going to take me to the police - station , "
44341	44375	44503	44503	he	582	" My cab 's at the door . If you 'll loose my legs I 'll walk down to it . I 'm not so light to lift as I used to be . "
44479	44502	44503	44503	he	582	" If there 's a vacant place for a chief of the police , I reckon you are the man for it , "
44516	44528	44539	44539	Holmes	110	" The way you kept on my trail was a caution . "
44529	44537	44553	44553	Lestrade	119	" You had better come with me , "
44545	44551	44503	44503	he	582	" I can drive you , "
44555	44587	44713	44713	he	1281	" Good ! and Gregson can come inside with me . You too , Doctor , you have taken an interest in the case and may as well stick to us . "
44696	44712	44713	44713	he	1281	" The prisoner will be put before the magistrates in the course of the week , "
44716	44754	44766	44767	our prisoner	1266	" in the mean time , Mr. Jefferson Hope , have you anything that you wish to say ? I must warn you that your words will be taken down , and may be used against you . "
44755	44765	44766	44767	our prisoner	1266	" I 've got a good deal to say , "
44771	44782	44796	44797	the Inspector	1284	" I want to tell you gentlemen all about it . "
44783	44794	44807	44807	he	1281	" Had n't you better reserve that for your trial ? "
44799	44806	44832	44832	He	1281	" I may never be tried , "
44810	44831	44854	44854	I	0	" You need n't look startled . It is n't suicide I am thinking of . Are you a Doctor ? "
44847	44853	44865	44865	he	1281	" Yes ; I am , "
44857	44864	44953	44953	I	0	" Then put your hand here , "
44949	44952	44953	44953	I	0	" Why , "
44956	44963	44973	44973	he	1281	" you have an aortic aneurism ! "
44964	44972	44973	44973	he	1281	" That 's what they call it , "
44978	45074	45111	45112	the former	414	" I went to a Doctor last week about it , and he told me that it is bound to burst before many days passed . It has been getting worse for years . I got it from over - exposure and under - feeding among the Salt Lake Mountains . I 've done my work now , and I do n't care how soon I go , but I should like to leave some account of the business behind me . I do n't want to be remembered as a common cut - throat . "
45097	45110	45122	45122	I	0	" Do you consider , Doctor , that there is immediate danger ? "
45115	45121	45148	45149	the Inspector	1284	" Most certainly there is , "
45125	45146	45148	45149	the Inspector	1284	" In that case it is clearly our duty , in the interests of justice , to take his statement , "
45151	45174	45186	45187	the prisoner	582	" You are at liberty , sir , to give your account , which I again warn you will be taken down . "
45175	45185	45186	45187	the prisoner	582	" I 'll sit down , with your leave , "
45197	45263	45355	45355	he	166	" This aneurism of mine makes me easily tired , and the tussle we had half an hour ago has not mended matters . I 'm on the brink of the grave , and I am not likely to lie to you . Every word I say is the absolute truth , and how you use it is a matter of no consequence to me . "
45340	45354	45355	45355	he	166	" It do n't much matter to you why I hated these men , "
45358	45466	46858	46858	I	0	" it 's enough that they were guilty of the death of two human beings - a father and a daughter - and that they had , therefore , forfeited their own lives . After the lapse of time that has passed since their crime , it was impossible for me to secure a conviction against them in any court . I knew of their guilt though , and I determined that I should be judge , jury , and executioner all rolled into one . You 'd have done the same , if you have any manhood in you , if you had been in my place .
45467	45626	45355	45355	he	166	" That girl that I spoke of was to have married me twenty years ago . She was forced into marrying that same Drebber , and broke her heart over it . I took the marriage ring from her dead finger , and I vowed that his dying eyes should rest upon that very ring , and that his last thoughts should be of the crime for which he was punished . I have carried it about with me , and have followed him and his accomplice over two continents until I caught them . They thought to tire me out , but they could not do it . If I die to - morrow , as is likely enough , I die knowing that my work in this world is done , and well done . They have perished , and by my hand . There is nothing left for me to hope for , or to desire .
45627	45793	46858	46858	I	0	" They were rich and I was poor , so that it was no easy matter for me to follow them . When I got to London my pocket was about empty , and I found that I must turn my hand to something for my living . Driving and riding are as natural to me as walking , so I applied at a cabowner 's office , and soon got employment . I was to bring a certain sum a week to the owner , and whatever was over that I might keep for myself . There was seldom much over , but I managed to scrape along somehow . The hardest job was to learn my way about , for I reckon that of all the mazes that ever were contrived , this city is the most confusing . I had a map beside me though , and when once I had spotted the principal hotels and stations , I got on pretty well .
45794	45897	45355	45355	he	166	" It was some time before I found out where my two gentlemen were living ; but I inquired and inquired until at last I dropped across them . They were at a boarding - house at Camberwell , over on the other side of the river . When once I found them out I knew that I had them at my mercy . I had grown my beard , and there was no chance of their recognizing me . I would dog them and follow them until I saw my opportunity . I was determined that they should not escape me again .
45898	46003	46858	46858	I	0	" They were very near doing it for all that . Go where they would about London , I was always at their heels . Sometimes I followed them on my cab , and sometimes on foot , but the former was the best , for then they could not get away from me . It was only early in the morning or late at night that I could earn anything , so that I began to get behind hand with my employer . I did not mind that , however , as long as I could lay my hand upon the men I wanted .
46004	46127	45355	45355	he	166	" They were very cunning , though . They must have thought that there was some chance of their being followed , for they would never go out alone , and never after nightfall . During two weeks I drove behind them every day , and never once saw them separate . Drebber himself was drunk half the time , but Stangerson was not to be caught napping . I watched them late and early , but never saw the ghost of a chance ; but I was not discouraged , for something told me that the hour had almost come . My only fear was that this thing in my chest might burst a little too soon and leave my work undone .
46128	46466	46858	46858	I	0	" At last , one evening I was driving up and down Torquay Terrace , as the street was called in which they boarded , when I saw a cab drive up to their door . Presently some luggage was brought out , and after a time Drebber and Stangerson followed it , and drove off . I whipped up my horse and kept within sight of them , feeling very ill at ease , for I feared that they were going to shift their quarters . At Euston Station they got out , and I left a boy to hold my horse , and followed them on to the platform . I heard them ask for the Liverpool train , and the guard answer that one had just gone and there would not be another for some hours . Stangerson seemed to be put out at that , but Drebber was rather pleased than otherwise . I got so close to them in the bustle that I could hear every word that passed between them . Drebber said that he had a little business of his own to do , and that if the other would wait for him he would soon rejoin him . His companion remonstrated with him , and reminded him that they had resolved to stick together . Drebber answered that the matter was a delicate one , and that he must go alone . I could not catch what Stangerson said to that , but the other burst out swearing , and reminded him that he was nothing more than his paid servant , and that he must not presume to dictate to him . On that the Secretary gave it up as a bad job , and simply bargained with him that if he missed the last train he should rejoin him at Halliday 's Private Hotel ; to which Drebber answered that he would be back on the platform before eleven , and made his way out of the station .
46467	46684	45355	45355	he	166	" The moment for which I had waited so long had at last come . I had my enemies within my power . Together they could protect each other , but singly they were at my mercy . I did not act , however , with undue precipitation . My plans were already formed . There is no satisfaction in vengeance unless the offender has time to realize who it is that strikes him , and why retribution has come upon him . I had my plans arranged by which I should have the opportunity of making the man who had wronged me understand that his old sin had found him out . It chanced that some days before a gentleman who had been engaged in looking over some houses in the Brixton Road had dropped the key of one of them in my carriage . It was claimed that same evening , and returned ; but in the interval I had taken a moulding of it , and had a duplicate constructed . By means of this I had access to at least one spot in this great city where I could rely upon being free from interruption . How to get Drebber to that house was the difficult problem which I had now to solve .
46685	46857	46876	46876	he	1292	" He walked down the road and went into one or two liquor shops , staying for nearly half - an - hour in the last of them . When he came out he staggered in his walk , and was evidently pretty well on . There was a hansom just in front of me , and he hailed it . I followed it so close that the nose of my horse was within a yard of his driver the whole way . We rattled across Waterloo Bridge and through miles of streets , until , to my astonishment , we found ourselves back in the Terrace in which he had boarded . I could not imagine what his intention was in returning there ; but I went on and pulled up my cab a hundred yards or so from the house . He entered it , and his hansom drove away . Give me a glass of water , if you please . My mouth gets dry with the talking . "
46870	46875	46876	46876	he	1292	" That 's better , "
46879	47067	45355	45355	he	166	" Well , I waited for a quarter of an hour , or more , when suddenly there came a noise like people struggling inside the house . Next moment the door was flung open and two men appeared , one of whom was Drebber , and the other was a young chap whom I had never seen before . This fellow had Drebber by the collar , and when they came to the head of the steps he gave him a shove and a kick which sent him half across the road . ' You hound , ' he cried , shaking his stick at him ; ' I 'll teach you to insult an honest girl ! ' He was so hot that I think he would have thrashed Drebber with his cudgel , only that the cur staggered away down the road as fast as his legs would carry him . He ran as far as the corner , and then , seeing my cab , he hailed me and jumped in . ' Drive me to Halliday 's Private Hotel , ' said he .
47068	47214	46876	46876	he	1292	" When I had him fairly inside my cab , my heart jumped so with joy that I feared lest at this last moment my aneurism might go wrong . I drove along slowly , weighing in my own mind what it was best to do . I might take him right out into the country , and there in some deserted lane have my last interview with him . I had almost decided upon this , when he solved the problem for me . The craze for drink had seized him again , and he ordered me to pull up outside a gin palace . He went in , leaving word that I should wait for him . There he remained until closing time , and when he came out he was so far gone that I knew the game was in my own hands .
47215	47489	45355	45355	he	166	" Do n't imagine that I intended to kill him in cold blood . It would only have been rigid justice if I had done so , but I could not bring myself to do it . I had long determined that he should have a show for his life if he chose to take advantage of it . Among the many billets which I have filled in America during my wandering life , I was once janitor and sweeper out of the laboratory at York College . One day the professor was lecturing on poisons , and he showed his students some alkaloid , as he called it , which he had extracted from some South American arrow poison , and which was so powerful that the least grain meant instant death . I spotted the bottle in which this preparation was kept , and when they were all gone , I helped myself to a little of it . I was a fairly good dispenser , so I worked this alkaloid into small , soluble pills , and each pill I put in a box with a similar pill made without the poison . I determined at the time that when I had my chance , my gentlemen should each have a draw out of one of these boxes , while I ate the pill that remained . It would be quite as deadly , and a good deal less noisy than firing across a handkerchief . From that day I had always my pill boxes about with me , and the time had now come when I was to use them .
47490	47662	46876	46876	he	1292	" It was nearer one than twelve , and a wild , bleak night , blowing hard and raining in torrents . Dismal as it was outside , I was glad within - so glad that I could have shouted out from pure exultation . If any of you gentlemen have ever pined for a thing , and longed for it during twenty long years , and then suddenly found it within your reach , you would understand my feelings . I lit a cigar , and puffed at it to steady my nerves , but my hands were trembling , and my temples throbbing with excitement . As I drove , I could see old John Ferrier and sweet Lucy looking at me out of the darkness and smiling at me , just as plain as I see you all in this room . All the way they were ahead of me , one on each side of the horse until I pulled up at the house in the Brixton Road .
47663	47724	45355	45355	he	166	" There was not a soul to be seen , nor a sound to be heard , except the dripping of the rain . When I looked in at the window , I found Drebber all huddled together in a drunken sleep . I shook him by the arm , ' It 's time to get out , ' I said .
47725	47735	46876	46876	he	1292	" ' All right , cabby , ' said he .
47736	47828	45355	45355	he	166	" I suppose he thought we had come to the hotel that he had mentioned , for he got out without another word , and followed me down the garden . I had to walk beside him to keep him steady , for he was still a little top - heavy . When we came to the door , I opened it , and led him into the front room . I give you my word that all the way , the father and the daughter were walking in front of us .
47829	47842	46876	46876	he	1292	" ' It 's infernally dark , ' said he , stamping about .
47843	47901	45355	45355	he	166	" ' We 'll soon have a light , ' I said , striking a match and putting it to a wax candle which I had brought with me . ' Now , Enoch Drebber , ' I continued , turning to him , and holding the light to my own face , ' who am I ? '
47902	48009	46876	46876	he	1292	" He gazed at me with bleared , drunken eyes for a moment , and then I saw a horror spring up in them , and convulse his whole features , which showed me that he knew me . He staggered back with a livid face , and I saw the perspiration break out upon his brow , while his teeth chattered in his head . At the sight , I leaned my back against the door and laughed loud and long . I had always known that vengeance would be sweet , but I had never hoped for the contentment of soul which now possessed me .
48010	48132	45355	45355	he	166	" ' You dog ! ' I said ; ' I have hunted you from Salt Lake City to St. Petersburg , and you have always escaped me . Now , at last your wanderings have come to an end , for either you or I shall never see to - morrow 's sun rise . ' He shrunk still further away as I spoke , and I could see on his face that he thought I was mad . So I was for the time . The pulses in my temples beat like sledge - hammers , and I believe I would have had a fit of some sort if the blood had not gushed from my nose and relieved me .
48133	48203	46876	46876	he	1292	" ' What do you think of Lucy Ferrier now ? ' I cried , locking the door , and shaking the key in his face . ' Punishment has been slow in coming , but it has overtaken you at last . ' I saw his coward lips tremble as I spoke . He would have begged for his life , but he knew well that it was useless .
48204	48214	45355	45355	he	166	" ' Would you murder me ? ' he stammered .
48215	48264	46876	46876	he	1292	" ' There is no murder , ' I answered . ' Who talks of murdering a mad dog ? What mercy had you upon my poor darling , when you dragged her from her slaughtered father , and bore her away to your accursed and shameless harem . '
48265	48279	45355	45355	he	166	" ' It was not I who killed her father , ' he cried .
48280	48352	46876	46876	he	1292	" ' But it was you who broke her innocent heart , ' I shrieked , thrusting the box before him . ' Let the high God judge between us . Choose and eat . There is death in one and life in the other . I shall take what you leave . Let us see if there is justice upon the earth , or if we are ruled by chance . '
48353	48534	45355	45355	he	166	" He cowered away with wild cries and prayers for mercy , but I drew my knife and held it to his throat until he had obeyed me . Then I swallowed the other , and we stood facing one another in silence for a minute or more , waiting to see which was to live and which was to die . Shall I ever forget the look which came over his face when the first warning pangs told him that the poison was in his system ? I laughed as I saw it , and held Lucy 's marriage ring in front of his eyes . It was but for a moment , for the action of the alkaloid is rapid . A spasm of pain contorted his features ; he threw his hands out in front of him , staggered , and then , with a hoarse cry , fell heavily upon the floor . I turned him over with my foot , and placed my hand upon his heart . There was no movement . He was dead !
48535	48822	46876	46876	he	1292	" The blood had been streaming from my nose , but I had taken no notice of it . I do n't know what it was that put it into my head to write upon the wall with it . Perhaps it was some mischievous idea of setting the police upon a wrong track , for I felt light - hearted and cheerful . I remembered a German being found in New York with RACHE written up above him , and it was argued at the time in the newspapers that the secret societies must have done it . I guessed that what puzzled the New Yorkers would puzzle the Londoners , so I dipped my finger in my own blood and printed it on a convenient place on the wall . Then I walked down to my cab and found that there was nobody about , and that the night was still very wild . I had driven some distance when I put my hand into the pocket in which I usually kept Lucy 's ring , and found that it was not there . I was thunderstruck at this , for it was the only memento that I had of her . Thinking that I might have dropped it when I stooped over Drebber 's body , I drove back , and leaving my cab in a side street , I went boldly up to the house - for I was ready to dare anything rather than lose the ring . When I arrived there , I walked right into the arms of a police - officer who was coming out , and only managed to disarm his suspicions by pretending to be hopelessly drunk .
48823	49082	45355	45355	he	166	" That was how Enoch Drebber came to his end . All I had to do then was to do as much for Stangerson , and so pay off John Ferrier 's debt . I knew that he was staying at Halliday 's Private Hotel , and I hung about all day , but he never came out . I fancy that he suspected something when Drebber failed to put in an appearance . He was cunning , was Stangerson , and always on his guard . If he thought he could keep me off by staying indoors he was very much mistaken . I soon found out which was the window of his bedroom , and early next morning I took advantage of some ladders which were lying in the lane behind the hotel , and so made my way into his room in the grey of the dawn . I woke him up and told him that the hour had come when he was to answer for the life he had taken so long before . I described Drebber 's death to him , and I gave him the same choice of the poisoned pills . Instead of grasping at the chance of safety which that offered him , he sprang from his bed and flew at my throat . In self - defence I stabbed him to the heart . It would have been the same in any case , for Providence would never have allowed his guilty hand to pick out anything but the poison .
49083	49243	49345	49346	Sherlock Holmes	110	" I have little more to say , and it 's as well , for I am about done up . I went on cabbing it for a day or so , intending to keep at it until I could save enough to take me back to America . I was standing in the yard when a ragged youngster asked if there was a cabby there called Jefferson Hope , and said that his cab was wanted by a gentleman at 221B , Baker Street . I went round , suspecting no harm , and the next thing I knew , this young man here had the bracelets on my wrists , and as neatly shackled as ever I saw in my life . That 's the whole of my story , gentlemen . You may consider me to be a murderer ; but I hold that I am just as much an officer of justice as you are . "
49328	49344	49345	49346	Sherlock Holmes	110	" There is only one point on which I should like a little more information , "
49351	49365	49383	49383	he	582	" Who was your accomplice who came for the ring which I advertised ? "
49374	49382	49383	49383	he	582	" I can tell my own secrets , "
49386	49439	49449	49449	Holmes	110	" but I do n't get other people into trouble . I saw your advertisement , and I thought it might be a plant , or it might be the ring which I wanted . My friend volunteered to go and see . I think you 'll own he did it smartly . "
49440	49447	49458	49459	the Inspector	1284	" Not a doubt of that , "
49452	49457	49502	49502	He	582	" Now , gentlemen , "
49463	49501	49669	49669	Holmes	110	" the forms of the law must be complied with . On Thursday the prisoner will be brought before the magistrates , and your attendance will be required . Until then I will be responsible for him . "
49657	49668	49669	49669	Holmes	110	" Gregson and Lestrade will be wild about his death , "
49680	49689	49707	49707	I	0	" Where will their grand advertisement be now ? "
49690	49706	49726	49727	my companion	243	" I do n't see that they had very much to do with his capture , "
49710	49724	49751	49751	he	166	" What you do in this world is a matter of no consequence , "
49731	49750	49751	49751	he	166	" The question is , what can you make people believe that you have done . Never mind , "
49761	49796	49801	49801	I	0	" I would not have missed the investigation for anything . There has been no better case within my recollection . Simple as it was , there were several most instructive points about it . "
49797	49800	49819	49820	Sherlock Holmes	110	" Simple ! "
49804	49817	49819	49820	Sherlock Holmes	110	" Well , really , it can hardly be described as otherwise , "
49827	49860	49868	49868	I.	0	" The proof of its intrinsic simplicity is , that without any help save a few very ordinary deductions I was able to lay my hand upon the criminal within three days . "
49861	49866	49819	49820	Sherlock Holmes	110	" That is true , "
49869	49971	49978	49978	I	0	" I have already explained to you that what is out of the common is usually a guide rather than a hindrance . In solving a problem of this sort , the grand thing is to be able to reason backwards . That is a very useful accomplishment , and a very easy one , but people do not practise it much . In the every - day affairs of life it is more useful to reason forwards , and so the other comes to be neglected . There are fifty who can reason synthetically for one who can reason analytically . "
49972	49976	49978	49978	I	0	" I confess , "
49980	49989	49819	49820	Sherlock Holmes	110	" that I do not quite follow you . "
49990	50104	50111	50111	I.	1311	" I hardly expected that you would . Let me see if I can make it clearer . Most people , if you describe a train of events to them , will tell you what the result would be . They can put those events together in their minds , and argue from them that something will come to pass . There are few people , however , who , if you told them a result , would be able to evolve from their own inner consciousness what the steps were which led up to that result . This power is what I mean when I talk of reasoning backwards , or analytically . "
50105	50109	49819	49820	Sherlock Holmes	110	" I understand , "
50112	50253	49819	49820	Sherlock Holmes	110	" Now this was a case in which you were given the result and had to find everything else for yourself . Now let me endeavour to show you the different steps in my reasoning . To begin at the beginning . I approached the house , as you know , on foot , and with my mind entirely free from all impressions . I naturally began by examining the roadway , and there , as I have already explained to you , I saw clearly the marks of a cab , which , I ascertained by inquiry , must have been there during the night . I satisfied myself that it was a cab and not a private carriage by the narrow gauge of the wheels . The ordinary London growler is considerably less wide than a gentleman 's brougham .
50254	50475	49819	49820	Sherlock Holmes	110	" This was the first point gained . I then walked slowly down the garden path , which happened to be composed of a clay soil , peculiarly suitable for taking impressions . No doubt it appeared to you to be a mere trampled line of slush , but to my trained eyes every mark upon its surface had a meaning . There is no branch of detective science which is so important and so much neglected as the art of tracing footsteps . Happily , I have always laid great stress upon it , and much practice has made it second nature to me . I saw the heavy footmarks of the constables , but I saw also the track of the two men who had first passed through the garden . It was easy to tell that they had been before the others , because in places their marks had been entirely obliterated by the others coming upon the top of them . In this way my second link was formed , which told me that the nocturnal visitors were two in number , one remarkable for his height ( as I calculated from the length of his stride ) , and the other fashionably dressed , to judge from the small and elegant impression left by his boots .
50476	50687	49819	49820	Sherlock Holmes	110	" On entering the house this last inference was confirmed . My well - booted man lay before me . The tall one , then , had done the murder , if murder there was . There was no wound upon the dead man 's person , but the agitated expression upon his face assured me that he had foreseen his fate before it came upon him . Men who die from heart disease , or any sudden natural cause , never by any chance exhibit agitation upon their features . Having sniffed the dead man 's lips I detected a slightly sour smell , and I came to the conclusion that he had had poison forced upon him . Again , I argued that it had been forced upon him from the hatred and fear expressed upon his face . By the method of exclusion , I had arrived at this result , for no other hypothesis would meet the facts . Do not imagine that it was a very unheard of idea . The forcible administration of poison is by no means a new thing in criminal annals . The cases of Dolsky in Odessa , and of Leturier in Montpellier , will occur at once to any toxicologist .
50688	50913	49819	49820	Sherlock Holmes	110	" And now came the great question as to the reason why . Robbery had not been the object of the murder , for nothing was taken . Was it politics , then , or was it a woman ? That was the question which confronted me . I was inclined from the first to the latter supposition . Political assassins are only too glad to do their work and to fly . This murder had , on the contrary , been done most deliberately , and the perpetrator had left his tracks all over the room , showing that he had been there all the time . It must have been a private wrong , and not a political one , which called for such a methodical revenge . When the inscription was discovered upon the wall I was more inclined than ever to my opinion . The thing was too evidently a blind . When the ring was found , however , it settled the question . Clearly the murderer had used it to remind his victim of some dead or absent woman . It was at this point that I asked Gregson whether he had enquired in his telegram to Cleveland as to any particular point in Mr. Drebber 's former career . He answered , you remember , in the negative .
50914	51058	49819	49820	Sherlock Holmes	110	" I then proceeded to make a careful examination of the room , which confirmed me in my opinion as to the murderer 's height , and furnished me with the additional details as to the Trichinopoly cigar and the length of his nails . I had already come to the conclusion , since there were no signs of a struggle , that the blood which covered the floor had burst from the murderer 's nose in his excitement . I could perceive that the track of blood coincided with the track of his feet . It is seldom that any man , unless he is very full - blooded , breaks out in this way through emotion , so I hazarded the opinion that the criminal was probably a robust and ruddy - faced man . Events proved that I had judged correctly .

I telegraphed to the head of the police at Cleveland , limiting my enquiry to the circumstances connected with the marriage of Enoch Drebber . The answer was conclusive . It told me that Drebber had already applied for the protection of the law against an old rival in love , named Jefferson Hope , and that this same Hope was at present in Europe . I knew now that I held the clue to the mystery in my hand , and all that remained was to secure the murderer .
51165	51327	49819	49820	Sherlock Holmes	110	" I had already determined in my own mind that the man who had walked into the house with Drebber , was none other than the man who had driven the cab . The marks in the road showed me that the horse had wandered on in a way which would have been impossible had there been anyone in charge of it . Where , then , could the driver be , unless he were inside the house ? Again , it is absurd to suppose that any sane man would carry out a deliberate crime under the very eyes , as it were , of a third person , who was sure to betray him . Lastly , supposing one man wished to dog another through London , what better means could he adopt than to turn cabdriver . All these considerations led me to the irresistible conclusion that Jefferson Hope was to be found among the jarveys of the Metropolis .
51328	51532	51539	51539	I	0	" If he had been one there was no reason to believe that he had ceased to be . On the contrary , from his point of view , any sudden change would be likely to draw attention to himself . He would , probably , for a time at least , continue to perform his duties . There was no reason to suppose that he was going under an assumed name . Why should he change his name in a country where no one knew his original one ? I therefore organized my Street Arab detective corps , and sent them systematically to every cab proprietor in London until they ferreted out the man that I wanted . How well they succeeded , and how quickly I took advantage of it , are still fresh in your recollection . The murder of Stangerson was an incident which was entirely unexpected , but which could hardly in any case have been prevented . Through it , as you know , I came into possession of the pills , the existence of which I had already surmised . You see the whole thing is a chain of logical sequences without a break or flaw . "

51630	51634	51539	51539	I	0	" The public , "
51638	51910	51924	51925	Sherlock Holmes	110	" have lost a sensational treat through the sudden death of the man Hope , who was suspected of the murder of Mr. Enoch Drebber and of Mr. Joseph Stangerson . The details of the case will probably be never known now , though we are informed upon good authority that the crime was the result of an old standing and romantic feud , in which love and Mormonism bore a part . It seems that both the victims belonged , in their younger days , to the Latter Day Saints , and Hope , the deceased prisoner , hails also from Salt Lake City . If the case has had no other effect , it , at least , brings out in the most striking manner the efficiency of our detective police force , and will serve as a lesson to all foreigners that they will do wisely to settle their feuds at home , and not to carry them on to British soil . It is an open secret that the credit of this smart capture belongs entirely to the well - known Scotland Yard officials , Messrs. Lestrade and Gregson . The man was apprehended , it appears , in the rooms of a certain Mr. Sherlock Holmes , who has himself , as an amateur , shown some talent in the detective line , and who , with such instructors , may hope in time to attain to some degree of their skill . It is expected that a testimonial of some sort will be presented to the two officers as a fitting recognition of their services . "
51911	51922	51924	51925	Sherlock Holmes	110	" Did n't I tell you so when we started ? "
51930	51948	51954	51954	I	0	" That 's the result of all our Study in Scarlet : to get them a testimonial ! "
51949	51953	51954	51954	I	0	" Never mind , "
51957	51992	51924	51925	Sherlock Holmes	110	" I have all the facts in my journal , and the public shall know them . In the meantime you must make yourself contented by the consciousness of success , like the Roman miser -
